== Overview

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the bidirectional relationship between flashcards and tags.
** What it does: Models the relationship between flashcards and tags: tags must have at least one flashcard, and flashcards can have any number of tags.
** Justification: This feature serves as the main organizing system for flashcards in Flashy. It allows users to
filter only flashcards they want to see.

* *Minor enhancement*: updated the list command to be able to clear all filters for flashcards and tags, as well as show only cards without tags.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/jethrokuan.md[Functional Code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/jethrokuan.md[Test Code]]
