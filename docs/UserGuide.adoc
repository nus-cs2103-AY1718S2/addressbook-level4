== Introduction

CollegeZone is for NUS students living in Residential College 4 (RC4) who *prefers to use a desktop app for managing their RC4 friends contacts and their tasks*. More importantly, CollegeZone is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CollegeZone can get your contact management and tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
