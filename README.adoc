*Welcome to contactHeRo!*

contactHeRo is a desktop Address Book application designed for Human Resources Managers at companies, especially those responsible for recruitment.

We understand that recruiters have a lot of contacts to
manage which include contact details and profiles of potential employees. It is essential for them to have a quick and easy access to these contacts. Hence, contactHero aims to make their lives easier by helping them to store and manage their contacts efficiently.

contactHeRo has a graphical user interface but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

So what are you waiting for? Head over to our <<UserGuide#, User Guide>> to get started!
