== Introduction

Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.
If you can type fast, EPIC can get your event planning tasks and registration processes for
events done faster than traditional (Graphical User Interface) GUI applications
or pen and paper registration.

This user guide will walk you through setting up EPIC on your computer, navigating within the
GUI, using the various features EPIC has.

== Quick Start

This section walks you through setting up EPIC on your computer, provides an overview of the UI
and goes through some example commands you can try.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EPIC.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for EPIC.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.


.GUI of EPIC
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to EPIC.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[NOTE]
Registrant refers to the person registered to a particular event.


[[Layout]]
== How to Use the GUI

This section describes the components of the GUI, and common ways to interact with it.
// tag::uilayout[]

=== Layout

The UI consists of the 5 main layout regions (<<#layout-of-epic>>):

[#layout-of-epic]
.Components of the GUI
image::Ui_annotated.png[width="750"]

. Command Box: text box to receive user input.
. Result Display: status bar that displays the result of user commands.
. Persons Pane: pane that lists all persons stored in EPIC.
. Events Pane: pane that lists all events stored in EPIC.
. Attendance Pane: pane that lists all registrants in the selected event.
// end::uilayout[]

[TIP]
The lists displayed in the panes can be filtered using the `find`, `find-event` `find-registrant` commands!

// tag::uiinteractions[]

=== Interacting with the GUI

* Clicking on an event in the Events Pane *selects* that event, allowing you to see all registrants for that event in the Attendance Pane,
as well as perform actions such as toggling attendance.
Selecting an event can also be done with the `select` command in the command box.


// end::uiinteractions[]

[[Features]]
== Features

This section details the various features EPIC supports.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

****
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. Han will not match Hans.
****

If your event contains too many registrants, it can be difficult to find information quickly. The
`find-registrant` command can be used to narrow down registrants by their name. Only persons whose
names contain any of the given keywords are displayed.

In our example, we'll apply a filter to display only registrants from the IoT Talk event with the
name "Alex".

. Select the IoT Event by executing `select-event 1`. Observe that Alex Yeoh is registered
. Execute `find-registrant alex`. This command filters the Attendance Pane, hiding anyone whose name does
not contain the word alex (case-insensitive).
. To remove the filter, execute `list-registrants`.

When a filter is applied, the header of the Attendance Pane will display `filtered`, and the attendance statistic will
be computed based on the filtered list. See <<#findregistrants>> below for UI changes. +

[#findregistrants]
.Illustration of `find-registrants` command (only the Attendance Pane is shown for clarity).

****
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans.

Format: `list-registrants EVENT_NAME`
// end::attendance-search[]



//tag::toggle[]
=== Toggle Attendance for Event Registrant : `toggle`

Toggles the attendance of a registrant to an event from attended to not attended and vice versa. +
Format: `toggle INDEX`

****
* Toggles the attendance of the registrant at the specified `INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number shown in the Attendance Pane.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `select-event 2` +
`toggle 3` +
Toggles the attendance of the 3rd registrant in the attendance list of
the 2nd event currently listed. See <<#toggle>> below for UI changes. +

[#toggle]
.Illustration of `toggle` command (only the Attendance Pane is shown for clarity).
image::ToggleUG.png[width="790"]
//end::toggle[]

=== Listing Entered Commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the up and down arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== Clearing all Entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from EPIC. +
Format: `clear`

// tag::undo[]
=== Undoing Commands : `undo`

Restores EPIC to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
There is no guarantee that the relative order of persons/events will be preserved after the undoing
of a `delete` or `delete-event` command (see the third example). +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify EPIC's content.
To see the full list of undoable commands, refer to <<List of undoable commands>>
====

Examples:

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails since neither `list` nor `select` is undoable.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` +
`undo` +
Undoes the `clear` command, followed by the `delete 1` command.

* `delete 2` +
`undo` +
Undoes the `delete 2` command. See <<#undoafter>> below for UI changes. In particular,
it shows that relative order of persons might not be preserved. +

[#undoafter]
.Illustration of `undo` command (only the Persons Pane is shown for clarity).
image::UndoUG.png[width="790"]

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]

=== Redoing Commands : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. This will *fail* if the most recent command
was neither `undo` nor `redo` (See last example below). +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` +
`redo` +
Redoes the `delete 1` command.

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` +
`undo` +
`redo` +
`redo` +
Redoes the `delete 1` command, followed by the `clear` command.

* `add-event n/MyEvent` +
`undo` +
`add-event n/MyEvent` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as the most recent command was not an `undo/redo` command. This
prevents ill-defined behavior like trying to add back an event that already exists.
// end::redo[]

Format: `exit`
