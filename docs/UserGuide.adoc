== Introduction

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students manage their tasks and events, such as:

* Keeping track of tasks and events and be reminded of their due dates.

* Recording all completed tasks and finished events, so that the student knows what he has done.

CLIndar is **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based  and uses **Linux-style commands**, which computing students are familiar with. Thus, compared to traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications,
CLIndar is faster and provides more convenience for computing students.

The current version of CLIndar is 1.5 and is available on Windows and Linux.

== Get Started

To start using CLIndar, follow the instructions below:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

.  Download the latest `CLIndar.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CLIndar.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as seen below.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

* *`task`* `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 d/16/03/2018 17:00 r/Enhance major component`: adds Software Engineering task to Desk Board.
* *`event`* `n/Software Project s/01/05/2018 8:00 e/01/08/2018 8:00 l/School of Computing`: adds Software Project event to Desk Board.
* *`ls task`* : lists all uncompleted tasks.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of commands in CLIndar.
// end::getstarted[]
[[Features]]
== Features

The following describes the command format in CLIndar:

* *Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.* +
For example, in the following format `task n/NAME`,
  `NAME` must be supplied by the user as the task name. The following is an example of the command to be keyed in by user:
  `task n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.

* *Items in square brackets are optional.* +
For example,  `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 r/urgent` or as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.

* *Parameters can be in any order.* +
For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATETIME`, `d/DATETIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.

// tag::helpcommand[]
=== Viewing help : `help` or `man` `[As of  v1.1]`

Shows the help menu for all of the commands or only the `COMMAND_WORD` requested.

*Format:* `help`, `help COMMAND_WORD`, `man` or `man COMMAND_WORD`

[NOTE]
DUE_DATE_TIME parameter can be in d/m/y h:m or dd/mm/yy hh:mm

*Examples:*

* `task n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 d/16/03/2018 17:00 r/urgent`
* `task n/Programming Methodology Assignment 2 d/16/3/2018 23:59`

=== Adding an event: `event` `[As of  v1.3]`

// end::taskevent[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit a task: `edit task` `[As of v1.5]`
Editing attributes of a task identified by its index in the task list.

[NOTE]
====
`edit command would simply replace the whole list of tags with the list of `tags` provided by the inputs rather than adding the `tags` to the tag list.
As such `edit task INDEX r/` would remove all the `tags` of the identified task.
====


=== Edit an event: `edit event` `[As of v1.5]`
Editing attributes of a event identified by its index in the event list.

*Format:* `edit event INDEX [n/NAME] [s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME] [l/LOCATION] [r/REMARK]`

Edit the 2nd event in the list.

* `edit task 3 r/` +
Removes all the tags of event 3

[NOTE]
====
`edit` command would simply replace the whole list of tags with the list of `tags` provided by the inputs rather than adding the `tags` to the tag list.
As such `edit event INDEX r/` would remove all the `tags` of the identified event.
====
// end::edit[]
// tag::listcommand[]
