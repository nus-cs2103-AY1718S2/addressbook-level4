== Overview
This Project Portfolio details my contributions to project EPIC, showing that I am capable of producing functional code,
and working in a team on a large project.

== PROJECT: EPIC
Event Planning isnâ€™t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*. EPIC handles event attendance management with
simplicity and efficiency. By storing all of the contacts in a common database, the same person
can be registered for multiple events without having to re-enter his or her details for each event.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: overhauled UI to a three-pane system that displays all persons, events and registrants of the selected
event in their respective panes.
** What it does: The three-pane system displaying stored persons, events and registrants. It automatically updates itself when there
are changes to the data.
** Justification: This feature *enhances the user experience* tremendously as the user can view all three panes
without having to cycle between lists. The clean and intuitive interface empowers the user
to type out commands that require parameters from all three lists without breaking his workflow.

** Highlights: This enhancement leverages several patterns such as the Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern, Observer
Pattern, and JavaFX Beans Convention to elegantly trigger UI updates upon data changes. Using such patterns made UI
updates *automatic and resource-efficient*.
//The feature was implemented in a
modular fashion, which makes maintenance and testing easy.
* *Minor enhancement*: added the `find-registrant` command that filters the attendance pane and the `list-registrants`
command that resets it.
