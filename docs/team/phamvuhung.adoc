== PROJECT: Fastis - MeetUp Manager

---

== Overview

Fastis is a desktop application that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively.
The application enables students to keep track of group membersâ€™ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos and schedule suitable meetup time.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Calendar feature*
** What it does: shows a calendar that allows the user to add events, such as group meetings and job interviews, with `addEvent` command.
** Justification: This feature helps the user, at a glance, to know if there are any upcoming events in order to prepare for them as well as to avoid planning any events that might clash with other events.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables users to better plan and prepare for any events, including group meetings. It requires a solid understanding of many JavaFX components and interactions, as well as interactions between different components of the application, namely `Model`, `UI`, and `Logic`.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Timetable feature*
** What it does: shows a timetable of any person in the address book, as long as their timetable link is imported. It also enables scheduling a suitable time slot for a group meeting based on the members' timetable.
** Justification: This feature helps the user quickly see their own timetable as well as others, and quickly plan a meeting time for the whole group, which helps a lot in group projects.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables users to better plan for group meetings, which works conjunction with the Calendar feature. For group meetings, once all members have their timetable link imported, all common free time slots for all members can be displayed with `scheduleGroup` command. Similarly, it requires a solid understanding of JavaFX components as well as the address book's components, namely `Model`, `UI`, and `Logic`.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *changing tags' color feature*: +
Allow users to better understand meaning of the tags at a glance, as well as better customize the application.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/tree/master/collated/functional/LeonidAgarth.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/LeonidAgarth.md[Test code]]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

//tag::Calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Calendar` class, adapted from https://github.com/SirGoose3432/javafx-calendar[javafx-calendar] by SirGoose3432.
It is used to view the user's upcoming events, e.g. interviews, meetings, etc.

==== Current implementation

The calendar feature is facilitated by `Calendar` and `CalendarDate` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the calendar
in the application when given a list of `Event` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `CalendarChangedEvent` is raised.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`Calendar` utilizes the `Event` class to determine which slots in the schedule are occupied.
Hence, a list of events is passed to every calendar upon construction and saved as a private variable.

The details of these event, e.g. time, location, are saved locally in `.xml` file format.
It is also retrieved upon start up by the `Storage` component and saved within the `Model` for the whole process.

The implementation of `Calendar` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Calendar(ObservableList<Event> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initCalendar();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initCalendar() {
    // ... Create the calendar 7x6 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 42 CalendarDate objects ...
    fillCalendar(currentYearMonth);
    showEvents();
    // ... show CalendarView ...
}

private void fillCalendar(YearMonth yearMonth) {
    // ... Fill the calendar with the correct dates according to yearMonth ...
}

private void showEvents() {
    // ... Show all events that are in the current yearMonth in the eventList ...
}
----

The current time is retrieved upon startup, and the calendar base on that point in time to display the appropriate time frame.

==== Design Considerations
[[calendarImplementation]]
===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Calendar`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a stand-alone `Calendar` class
** Pros:
*** Easy to manipulate data.
*** Easy to customize appearance.
** Cons:
*** Likely not optimized implementation.
*** Might not be aesthetically pleasing.
* **Alternative 2:** Import external libraries/API
** Choices:
*** https://developers.google.com/calendar/[Google Calendar API]
*** https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX]
** Pros:
*** Likely optimized algorithms.
*** Aesthetically pleasing.
** Cons:
*** Restricted to what the libraries/API offer.
*** Need a firm understanding of the whole API to implement well.

===== Aspect: Storing of the `eventList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `eventList` within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: Easy to show events and their details, even after the constructor returns.
** Cons: Takes up some redundant memory if there are no commands for showing these events.
* **Alternative 2:** Only passes the `eventList` as a parameter to the constructor and not storing it as a field within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: Codes are less cluttered and less memory is used.
** Cons: Hard to show events and their details outside of the constructor.
// end::Calendar[]

//tag::Timetable[]
[[Timetable]]
=== Timetable feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Timetable` class, based largely on the `Calendar` class. It is used to view the user's own NUSMods timetable as well as that of other people in his address book.

==== Current implementation

The timetable is the weekly equivalent to the monthly Calendar.
This feature is similarly facilitated by the analogous `Timetable` and `TimetableSlot` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the timetable
in the application when given a list of `WeeklyEvent` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `TimetableChangedEvent` is raised.
This is done either by a precedent `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` or a `ScheduleGroupCommand`.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::TimetableSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `Timetable` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Timetable(ObservableList<WeeklyEvent> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initTimetable();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initTimetable() {
    // ... Create the calendar 6x11 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 66 TimetableSlot objects ...
    clearTimetable();
    showSlots();
    // ... show TimetableView ...
}

private void clearTimetable() {
    // ... Draw all slots as blank ...
    // ... Draw the timeline on the left ...
}

private void showSlots() {
    // ... Show all slots that are in the in the eventList ...
    // ... Make sure no 2 modules with different name would have the same color ...
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Timetable` and Storing of the `eventList`
As the weekly equivalent of `Calendar`, `Timetable` has the same aspect to consider. See <<calendarImplementation, Implementation of the Calendar>>.

===== Aspect: Supporting modules on weekends and/or after 6pm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Don't support showing those modules
** Pros: Make the GUI less cluttered and more readable
** Cons:
*** Cannot cater to users with those modules in their timetable
*** Cannot schedule meetings on the weekends
* **Alternative 2:** Support showing those modules
** Pros: Catering to users with those modules, and support scheduling for the weekends.
** Cons: As the GUI already have 2 other main components which are the PersonListPanel and TodoListPanel, adding more columns to the Timetable makes it looks cluttered.
// end::Timetable[]


//tag::Scheduling[]
[[Scheduling]]
=== Scheduling meetings feature
Fastis supports showing all the common free time slots for all members in based on their timetable.

==== Current implementation
Fastis utilizes a few components to schedule the meetings, namely the `Group` class and `WeeklyEvent` class in `Model`, `Timetable` in `UI`, and `parseEvents()` in `Database`.
The command to show the scheduled meetings is `ScheduleGroupCommand`, which resides in `Logic` component.

When a `ScheduleGroupCommand` is executed, it first gets all group members from `Model`.
For each member, it parses the `TimetableLink` to get all of his/her modules, and add them to an `occupied` list.
From that list, the command generates all free time slots in another list called `free`, and post that event to be handled by the `UI` component later.

The flow of operation is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::ScheduleGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public ScheduleGroupCommand(Group group) {
    requireNonNull(group);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    EventsCenter.getInstance().registerHandler(this);
}

public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    // ... Get the group's member from Model ...
    fillTimeSlots(group);
    generateFreeTimeSlots();
    // ... Post new TimetableChangedEvent ...
    // ... Return new CommandResult ...
}

private void fillTimeSlots(Group group) {
    for (Person member : group.getPersonList()) {
        // ... Parse the TimetableLink into moduleList
        // ... Add all modules in moduleList to occupied list
    }
}

private void generateFreeTimeSlots() {
    // ... Generate free time slots logic
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Scheduling algorithm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show all free time slots
** Pros: Intuitive for users, and easy to read.
** Cons: Slow, as there are a few extra steps to process.
* **Alternative 2:** Show all occupied time slots
** Pros: Very fast.
** Cons:
*** Could become cluttered as there are normally more occupied slots than free slots.
*** Not intuitive for users.
// end::Scheduling[]


// tag::ChangeTagColor[]
=== Tag Color feature
Fastis supports changing the color of the tags given to people in the address book. There are up to 17 colors to choose from.

==== Current implementation

Changing a tag's color is facilitated by `ChangeTagColorCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports modifying the `color` field within `Tag` objects.

The flow of operation is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::ChangeTagColorSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`ChangeTagColorCommand` inherit from `UndoableCommand`, therefore it can be undone and redone using `UndoRedoStack`.

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class ChangeTagColorCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // .. Get the tag's name and color from Model
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... Update tag in Model ...
        // ... Update Person list in Model ...
        // ... Return new CommandResult ...
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Different tags with the same color

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow
** Pros:
*** Users have more freedom.
*** Code is shorter.
** Cons: Might result in aesthetically unpleasing GUI
* **Alternative 2:** Disallow
** Pros:
*** More intuitive.
*** Ensure aesthetic values for GUI.
** Cons: Code is longer.
