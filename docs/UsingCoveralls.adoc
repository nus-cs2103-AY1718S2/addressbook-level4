https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls, window="_blank"] is a web service that tracks code coverage over time for GitHub projects.
Coveralls requires CircleCI to be set up beforehand as CircleCI sends the coverage report from the latest build to Coveralls.
If you have not set up CircleCI, see <<UsingCircleCI#, UsingCircleCI.adoc>>. Note that Coveralls also supports Travis CI and AppVeyor.

== Setting up Coveralls

.  Go to https://coveralls.io/[https://coveralls.io/, window="_blank"] and click `SIGN IN`. Then click `GITHUB SIGN IN` and enter your GitHub account details if needed.
+
.  After logging in, you will be brought to the `Your Repositories` page. On the site's navigation bar, click https://coveralls.io/repos/new[ADD REPOS, window="_blank"].
+
.  Find the switch for the forked repository.
* If the organization is not shown, click `GITHUB SETTINGS` as shown below:
+

+
This should bring you to a GitHub page that manages the access of third-party applications. Depending on whether you are the owner of the repository, you can either grant access
+

+
or request access

+
to Coveralls so that it can access your repository.
* If your repository cannot be found, click `SYNC REPOS`.

.  Update the link of the `Coverage Status` badge at the top of your <<README#, README.adoc>> to point to that of your own repo
by replacing the `<username>` with your GitHub username (or GitHub organization, if your repository belongs to one) and `<repo>` with your repository name.

== Disabling Coveralls Automatic Comments on Pull Requests

Coveralls automatically comments on the coverage status of the pull requests in GitHub. If it's a hindrance, you can disable it in the settings of your project in Coveralls:

.  Click `Settings`.
+
.  Uncheck the `LEAVE COMMENTS?` checkbox. Then click `SAVE CHANGES`.
