==== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import job entries from an excel file*
** What it does: allows the user to collate job entries from different people in the form of excel files.
Also allows discrete accepting and rejecting of job entries, with comments written to another excel file.
** Justification: A significant improvement to CarviciM by simplifying collation of job entries
from different sources, which managers often do from admins, hence saving time and effort.
** Highlights: This enhancement supports autosave feature and handles IOException thoroughly. Job entries with empty
fields will inherit their empty fields from the previous entry. Column headers can be added if necessary,
and does not enforce strict order.
** Credits: Apache POI and Commons library are used to support exccel file handling.
* *Minor enhancement*: added a set command that allows the user to have a customized set of keywords as an
alternative to the original.
