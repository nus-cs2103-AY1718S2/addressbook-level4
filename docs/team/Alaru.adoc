== PROJECT: Your TA

---

== Overview

Your TA is an application designed to fulfill the needs of a university tutor. It helps them to manage their students and tasks that they have to do.
Your TA uses a graphical user interface built using JavaFX and the user interacts with the application mostly through a command line interface.
Your TA is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

Your TA is build upon https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4].

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added a display picture/status to all persons in the application.
** What it does: It allows the user to save a display picture to any student in the application. It also allows the tutor to have a quick glance to check if the student has been participating enough.

** Justification: This feature provides the tutor with a visual stimulus on how the student looks. This way, the tutor would be able to quickly associate the student's name and their face
which in turn allow the tutor to remember their students better. This would encourage a more holistic environment for teaching and learning as it would make it more
personal between the tutor and the student. It utilizes a drop shadow frame which shows whether the student has at least participated sufficiently in classes.

** Highlights: This enhancement fully supports the existing undo and redo even though image files are stored outside the `AddressBook` memory.
The existing commands (add, edit, delete and clear) were also updated to support the adding and changing of display pictures.

** Additional changes: Had to modify the codebase to ensure that `add`, `edit`, and `clear` works with the display picture field as well. Relevant tests were updated.

** Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970947/elliott-frisch[Elliott Frisch] from stackoverflow on the SHA-256 hash algorithm used to generate the name of the image file.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a `Participation` attribute to `Person` to keep track of a student's participation level. It supports the addition of marks to the `Person` object.
