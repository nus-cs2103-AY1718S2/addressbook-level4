== PROJECT: CoinBook

---

== Overview

CoinBook is a desktop accounting application written in Java. It is targeted at cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts, and allows them to keep track of the coins they hold, obtain price data and analytics, and read the latest news relevant to them in the same place. Primary interaction is through a CLI, and a GUI built with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a sync command that *updates all price-related metrics of cryptocurrencies with latest, live data*
** What it does: allows the user to keep up to date with the latest price movements of cryptocurrencies invested.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the volatile market that cryptocurrencies operate in necessitates that a user is frequently kept up to date with all changes in cryptocurrency prices.
** Highlights: This enhancement demonstrates live updating of data from external web APIs. It required analysis of design alternatives between synchronous and asynchronous data fetching. The implementation too was challenging as it required many utilities to be built such as UrlBuilderUtil to adhere to HTTP request formats and FetchUtil to perform API calls.
** Credits: External libraries used include: [http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/overview-summary.html[Apache HttpClient]], [https://github.com/google/gson/[GSON]] and [https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client[AsyncHttpClient]]

* *Minor enhancement*: added a autocomplete feature that allows users to quickly enter in command.
