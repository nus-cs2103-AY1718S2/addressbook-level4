== Introduction

PrioriTask is a desktop task management application. It is not just any task management application, but a combination of the to-do list, calendar and reminder features, with an added bonus of automatic updating and sorting of your tasks based on priority levels. It helps you keep track of your tasks, while providing you with at-a-glance views of upcoming tasks by day, week or month. PrioriTask is optimized for those who prefer to interact with an application by typing commands instead of clicking using a cursor.

This guide will show you how to get started using PrioriTask, and will introduce you to the different features PrioriTask has.

This section explains the functions and usages of PrioriTask's different features.

=== User interface of PrioriTask

PrioriTask consists of six different sections (refer to <<fig-DifferentComponents>>).

[[fig-DifferentComponents]]
.The Different Sections of PrioriTask
image::UserGuideDifferentComponents.png[width="650"]

Given below is a quick overview of each section.

. `Menu Bar`, where you will be able to:
.. Exit the application (`File` > `Exit`).
.. Open the Help Window (`Help` > `Help  F1`).
. `Task List Panel`, which displays the tasks and their respective details. The tasks are organised by their priority levels, with the highest priority level at the top.
. `Calendar Panel`, which displays the calendar a chronological overview of the deadlines of all your tasks. It will display the current month by default.
. `Result Display Box`, which displays a successful or warning message depending on the command you execute.
. `Command Box`, where you input the command to be executed. Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the command after you have finished typing.
. `Status Bar Footer`, which displays:
.. The date and time of the last time you have made changes to the data.
.. The user status.
.. The folder address of where your data file is being stored.

=== Command format

In the following sections, you will be introduced to several commands and their command formats. Here are a few things to take note of:

* Most command words have aliases.
** E.g. `a` is the alias for the add command. Both `add` and `a` executes the same command.
* The command word and alias are case-sensitive.
** icon:check[] Typing `help` executes the command.
** icon:times[] Typing `Help`, `heLp` or `HELP` does not execute the command.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
** E.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/CS2103T Developer Guide`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
** E.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/CS2103T Developer Guide t/CS2103` or as `n/CS2103T Developer Guide`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
** E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), or `t/CS2103`, `t/CS2103 t/CS2101` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.
** E.g. If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PRIORITY_LEVEL`, `p/PRIORITY_LEVEL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
