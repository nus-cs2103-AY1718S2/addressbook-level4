== Project: TeachConnect

== 1. Overview
*TeachConnect (TC)* is command line application designed to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. It is an application for a user who loves to type - in other words, it uses a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*. All output is displayed on a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* - which is just the computer application screen. If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional contact books.

== 3. Summary of Contributions

*Major enhancement*: Sharing of Contacts +
*What it does*: allows users to import or export contacts in various file formats depending on conditions the user gives. +
*Justification* : Teachers in general take up new classes and hence it is necessary for them to share the contact details of all the students in the class. They are also very sociable people and exchanging contacts between themselves should be made as simple and seamless as possible.

*Minor enhancements*: Creating Personalised Shortcuts for any command +
*What it does*: allows users to set multiple shortcuts for any command they wish. They can also choose to delete shortcuts. +
*Justification* : TeachConnect comes with a lot of features and each feature has its own command word. The most gruelling part is remembering the exact command word as stated in the user guide. To overcome this the shortcut command helps keep aliases to the commands there by helping teachers better remember the command words they are comfortable with.

=== A.2 Enhancement Proposed: Using Natural Language Processing for Detecting Events

==== External Behaviour

This feature will help in integrating the mails we receive and appointments in those mails with TeachConnect. TeachConnect will be automatically be able to predict the events and suggest appointments/tasks using NLP in the emails.

==== Justification

This feature will make it easier for teachers to set appointments with students who mail them regarding extra classes or consultation. This will also increase the scope of the product to help teachers make and set tasks for various other factors not related to students.

==== Implementation

A connection will be first established between TeachConnect and the user's default email service provider.

Through the following use case diagram, the teacher will be able to set appointments with students or other people.
