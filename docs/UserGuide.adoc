By: `LoanShark Tycoon`      Since: `Jan 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

LoanShark Tycoon is for 21st century Loanshark bosses who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing operations*. More
importantly, LoanShark Tycoon is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, LoanShark Tycoon can get your
operations management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `LoanSharkTycoon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]. (_to be updated_)
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n: John Doe p: 98765432 e: johnd@example.com a: John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a person named `John Doe` to the database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the third contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the application

== Command Summary

[NOTE]
====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n: NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n: John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n: NAME [t: TAG]` can be used as `n: John Doe t: friend` or as `n: John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t: TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t: friend`, `t: friend t: family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n: NAME p: PHONE_NUMBER`, `p: PHONE_NUMBER n: NAME` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

[qanda]
How do I transfer my data to another Computer?::
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. By default, the path for the data file is "data/addressbook.xml".
