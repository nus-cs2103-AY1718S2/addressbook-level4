== Overview

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=applicationDescription]

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability for cloud storage of the data in ReciRecipé.
** What it does: It allows the user to upload all the recipes they have saved in the application onto their own Dropbox account.
** Justification: Saving all of their painstakingly searched, added or crafted recipes solely on their own hard drives is very risky as it could be lost very easily. Furthermore, if they accidentally cleared and closed the app, all the data will disappear too.
This function allows them to retrieve their recipes any time they want from any computer, as long as they have ReciRecipé.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves authentication and authorization from Dropbox. It required an in-depth understanding of the Dropbox APIs and how to handle authorization codes and access tokens.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new command `tag` that allowed user to search for recipes with the specified tagname(s). [OR search]
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new command `ingredient` that allowed user to search for recipes with the specified ingredient(s). [AND search]

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/nicholasangcx.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/nicholasangcx.md[Test code]]

== Code Contributions
|===
|_Given below are the code enhancements I have made to the project and also sections I contributed to the Developer Guide based on those enhancements. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

=== Major Enhancement: Cloud Storage
This feature has been implemented in version 1.3, in link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/79[PR #79] and link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/88[PR #88].
Quite a bit of additional work was required as I had to change my original implementation due to Dropbox not supporting login through a Webview. A system browser was used in the end and a lot of the underlying implementation code had to be changed.

==== Why?
Saving all of their painstakingly searched, added or crafted recipes solely on their own hard drives is very risky as it could be lost very easily. Furthermore, if they accidentally cleared and closed the app, all the data will disappear too.

=== Minor Enhancement: Tag Search
This feature has been implemented in version 1.1, in link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/33[PR #33].
This feature allows the user to search for recipes based on the tags allocated to them.

==== Why?
This allows the user to organise their recipes more efficiently and can obtain the ones they are interested in faster. For example, tagging their frequently used recipes with favourites, a simple search of favourites would list all those recipes immediately.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tag-search]

=== Minor Enhancement: Ingredient Search
This feature has been implemented in version 1.4, in link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/pull/98[PR #98]. This feature allows the user to search for recipes based on the ingredients specified within them.

==== Why?
This allows the user to maximise the ingredients they currently have, searching for recipes that contain ALL the ingredients that they have searched for.
