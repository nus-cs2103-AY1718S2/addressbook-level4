== Overview

This Project Portfolio details my contributions to project EPIC, which demonstrates that I am capable of producing functional code,
and working in a team on a large project.

== PROJECT: EPIC

Event Planning isnâ€™t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*. EPIC handles event attendance management with
simplicity and efficiency. By storing all of the contacts in a common database, the same person
can be registered for multiple events without having to re-enter his or her details for each event.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: Implementation of event-person interactions
** Description: Persons can be registered for/deregistered from events, and a particular event's participants can be
displayed. These functions form the core of the application.
** Design Decisions: There were various design decisions I had to make through the course of implementing these interactions.
Two of the most notable ones are:
*** Editing of persons is done in a mutable manner.
*** Deletion of persons still registered for an event is not allowed.
** Justification: I made the above choices for the following reasons:
*** Mutable edit - Allows editing of persons to be done in an efficient manner; events automatically receive the edited participant's
data, without the need to duplicate the data and update each event manually.
*** Deletion constraint - Acts as a safeguard to ensure that every participant's data is present during event registration.
** Highlights: This enhancement was done across multiple components:
*** Modified the Model component to allow navigability from events to persons.
*** Added new commands to the Logic component, and provided their implementation.
*** Ensured that the UI component updates whenever a person is edited, even when it is done in a mutable manner, and similarly
when a person is registered for/deregistered from an event.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Overhaul of undo-redo functionality
** Previous Implementation: In the previous iteration of the product, the *entire* memory contents of the application were duplicated
and stored to facilitate undoing/redoing commands.
** Current Implementation: In EPIC v1.5, _every_ undoable command now learns how to undo/redo itself in the pre-processing
stage. This knowledge is stored alongside the command.
** Justification: The new implementation only requires essential, and hence minimal, information to be stored, *significantly
reducing memory consumption* of EPIC.
