== PROJECT: Pigeons

---

== Overview

Pigeons is a desktop delivery planning application
used by delivery companies to plan for their delivery services effectively.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *use Google Map Distance Matrix API as the backbones to create optimized routes, to plan for trips*
** Application: apply to various parts of one of my minor enhancement(distance command) and one of my friend enhancement(filter command).
** Justification: This enhancement is used to calculate distance between locations,
providing data for us determine whether a specific address is exist or not. Then we can create the optimized route for the driver.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
Moreover, there are many more useful data that we can extract from the Distance Matrix such as estimated durations for different vehicles.
** Credits: Google Map Distance Matrix API for Java.

* *Major enhancement*: *created events to handle all possible cases related to the main display panel*
** What it does: load the needed route(s) on Google Map if possible(there is at least one existed address) or display errors on result display panel.
** Justification: This enhancement help the drivers visualising the locations on the map as well as show them possible routes and which are the optimized routes.
** Highlights: This enhancement is affected a lot by many existing commands and commands to be added in future.
Therefore, any future commands, which create events to change the display of the main display panel, require carefulness from the developer(s).

* *Minor enhancement*: added *Distance Command* to calculate distance from 2 locations so that the driver can plan his trip better.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *Sound system* to welcome user after login and read person card name.

=== Finding distance : `distance`

Finds the distance from the headquarter to the person address. +
Format: `distance INDEX (INDEX)`

****
* Selects the person and loads the distance from the headquarter to the person address `INDEX`. Or selects 2 person and
load the distance from the first person to the second person.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
* **The person(s) address(es) should be valid, existing. Else, the program might auto-generated some other address(ed).**
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`distance 2 3` +
Return the distance from the 2nd person to the 3rd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`distance 1` +
Return the distance from the headquarter to the 1st person name Betsy in the address book.

=== Retrieving distance from a person address to another person address

Like other commands, distance command uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The distance command execution won't affect the `Model` or raise any events since it only return the distance result.

However, the result is depend on the `GetDistance` class which will using the `Google Map API` to calculate the distance from the HQ to the person address.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `distance` command works:

=== Virtual assistant (script based reader)

==== Running scripts:

If the user operating system is either `Window` or `Mac OS` then every time, right after logging in, the system will run a script says "Welcome user". Moreover, whenever the user click on
a person card or use `Select command` to prefer to a person card, the system will read out "This is + `the person name` ".

We use `Runtime.java` in `java.lang` package to `execute` the scripts via the corresponding executor (`osascript` for `Mac` and `wscript` for `Window`.

==== Creating scripts

* For Window:
** First, the program will create folder `script` if it is not existed.
** Then in the `script` folder, the program will look for the corresponding `vbs` script. If the script is not existed,
*** Our system will use `File.java` to automatically create a `text` file and fill in the needed info for the `vbs` script file.
*** After that, we will convert the `text` file into the `vbs` file using `File.java`.

* For Mac:
** The program will not need to create any folder or script file but rather initialize a `String` array with
all the contents of the script.

=== Virtual assistant
. Reads out a person name and shows route from the Headquarter to the person address:

.. Prerequisites: The last shown list is not empty. The first person in the last shown list has a valid, existing address.
.. Test case: `click on the first person card` or use command `select 1` +
   Expected: The system reads out "This is + `the first person name` " and the main display panel loads the route on Google Map from the `Headquarter`
   to the `first person address`. Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `click on a person card` or use command `select` to select a person with an invalid address (such as: "Dummy Address") +
   Expected: The system reads out "This is + `the person name` " and the main display panel either loads only the location on Google Map of the `Headquarter`
   or the route from the `Headquarter` to an address which might sounds alike (auto generated by Google Map). Status bar remains the same.

=== Retrieving distance from 2 end points

. Retrieving distance from `Headquarter` to a `person address`  :

.. Prerequisites: The last shown list is not empty. The first person in the last shown list has a valid, existing address.
.. Test case: `distance 1` +
   Expected: The command result panel shows the distance from the `Headquarter` to the `first person address` and the main display panel loads the route on Google Map from the `Headquarter`
   to the `first person address`. Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `distance x` with x is the index of a person with invalid or non-existing address +
   Expected: The command result panel shows "Unable to find + `person name` + address" and the main display panel either loads only the location on Google Map of the `Headquarter`
   or the route from the `Headquarter` to an address which might sounds alike (auto generated by Google Map). Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `distance 0` +
   Expected: Error details shown in the command result panel. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect distance commands to try: `distance`, `distance x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

. Retrieving distance from a `person address` to another `person address` :
.. Prerequisites: The last shown list has more than 1 person. The first person and the second in the last shown list have valid, existing addresses.
.. Test case: `distance 1 2` +
   Expected: The command result panel shows the distance from the `first person address` to the `second person address` and the main display panel loads the route on Google Map from the `first person address`
   to the `second person address`. Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `distance 1 x` with x is the index of a person with invalid or non-existing address +
   Expected: The command result panel shows "Unable to find at least on address" and the main display panel either loads only the location on Google Map of one of the addresses or the route from the addressed which might sound alike (auto generated by Google Map). Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `distance 0 1` +
   Expected: Error details shown in the command result panel. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect distance commands to try: `distance`, `distance 0 x`, `distance x y` (where x and y are larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
