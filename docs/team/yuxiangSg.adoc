== PROJECT: Smart Insurance Collection

---

== Overview

ASmart Insurance Collection(SIC) is for insurance agents who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments*. More importantly, SIC is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Calendar with appointment related features*
** What it does: allows the user to add/remove/edit appointments and reflect these appointments on a calendar GUI
** Justification: These feature improves the product significantly because a user can now manage both contacts and appointments related to these contacts on the app
** Highlights: This enhancement touches on all components of the app and create a calendar and task model to enable future implementation of related enhancements. The additions to the components were written in such a way that the previous architecture is largely preserved.
** Credits: This enhancement depends heavily on the https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFx] third party library

* *Minor enhancement*: added look and back feature switch between day view and month view of the calendar GUI
