using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application specifically catered for salespeople to help them categorise leads more optimally.
* This application addresses the needs of salespeople, namely: categorise leads and contacts to know potential sales targets and list of leads from past sales transactions,
 port in their LinkedIn profile, and identifies potential duplicate entries.
* In summary, this CRM application is a viable form of assistance to manage Leads and Contacts more optimally for future sales decisions.
