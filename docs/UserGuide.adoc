== Introduction

*Your TA* is for university teaching assistants who prefer to use a desktop application to manage student contacts and plan their schedules. Your TA includes features such as,
a login system, the ability to store information of various students, the ability to schedule different tasks along with a calendar that displays the tasks, and many more!
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
If you can type fast, it can get your contact management and tasks scheduling done faster than traditional GUI applications.

== Quick Start

Your TA is an application with many features. Here is a quick start guide on using Your TA:

.  Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `YourTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The Login GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in Figure 1 below.
+

image::Login.png[width="500"]

.  Enter your `Username` and `Password` to log in. _Refer to <<Features>> for details of the feature._
.  After logging in, now you should see the main Application GUI in turn appear, as shown in Figure 2 below.

Tips on using the command box:

*  The command box is where you type in commands followed by pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window for the application.
*  Some example commands you can try:

** *`list`* : lists all contacts.
** **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the application.
** **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
** *`exit`* : exits the application.

*  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Login Feature

Before you are able to access the application, login is required.
====
* Enter your `Username` and `Password` in the respective fields. +
* Click on the `login` button.
* If you have entered either of those incorrectly, the text "[Existing user: Incorrect password entered][New User: Password must contain 8-30 characters]" will be displayed.
 This means that if you are an existing user, you have typed in an incorrect password, and if you are a new user, your password does not meet the specified requirements for a creation of a password.
 You have an unlimited number of tries to log in. +
* Upon successful login, the application will load with your previously saved data.
====

[NOTE]
Both `Username` and `Password` fields are case-sensitive.

[TIP]
If you are a first-time user, create an account by entering your desired `Username` and `Password` in the username and password text fields respectively. +
Then, click on the `Login` button.

Example:

New User: newUser +
Password: Iamanewuser

Upon typing in the credentials, a new instance of `Your TA` will start up as seen in figure 3 below.

.The main Application GUI upon login.
image::Ui.png[width="800"]

If you log out and then log back in using the same username but a wrong password, say "Iamnotanewuser".
The error message will be displayed indicating a wrong password as seen in Figure 4 below.

.The main Application GUI upon login.

== Command Info

These are guidelines on how the command format will be represented in the rest of this guide.

====
*Command Format*

* There are some equivalent shortcut commands known as _aliases_ with fewer alphabetic letters or a sign. +
e.g. to add a person to the addressbook, you can type 'add n/John Doe', 'a n/John Doe' or '+ n/John Doe'.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero). +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, or even not used at all.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====


== Help Feature

This guide can be opened in `Your TA` itself, with the use of the `help` command.

Viewing help : `help`

Alias: `?` +
Format: `help`
[NOTE]
This opens a help window which explains what commands can be used, and how to use them.

== Contact Features

This section goes in depth into the commands available for the people (students) stored in `Your TA`, and how they are used.

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book. +
Alias: `a` and `+` +
Format: `add n/NAME m/MATRICULATION NUMBER p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS dp/[IMAGE PATH] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
Both the display picture and tags fields are optional, and a person can have any number of tags (including zero).

[NOTE]
====
** The tags "lecturer", "TA" "student" and "T1" will appear red, yellow, blue and green respectively.
** Do refrain from using high resolution images as display pictures, the optimum resolution is 500 x 500 pixels.
====

[WARNING]
The name field of Your TA will allow duplicate names to be stored. However the matriculation number field does not allows duplicates.

Examples:

The address book initially starts with default inputs as displayed in Figure 5:

.Initial Address Book State +
image::UiInitialClear.png[width="800"]

Let's try entering a command, such as the one below: +

Command entered: `add n/John Doe m/A0111111X p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dp/C:\Users\Name\Desktop\John.jpg` +
[NOTE]
The filepath after the `dp/` depends on where your image file is located.
This will add a person, 'John Doe' into the list with his respective details into the application (Figure 6).

.Application after John Doe has been Added +
image::UiAfterFirst.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend m/A1234567C e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal` +
This will add a person, 'Betsy Crowe' into the list with her respective details into the application (Figure 7).

.Application after Betsy Crowe has been added +
image::UiAfterSecond.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
You may leave the `dp/` portion empty if you do not have a profile picture. The application will default to using the default profile picture.


=== Locating persons by name or by matriculation number: `find`


Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Or, finds a person whose matriculation number corresponds to the given keyword. +

Alias: `f` +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the name and the matriculation number is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
****

Examples:

Address book starts with the following as shown in Figure 8:

.Application before People are Added. +
