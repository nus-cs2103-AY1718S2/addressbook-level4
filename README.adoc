PrioriTask is a desktop Task Management application.

This application's main aim is to help busy university students keep track of their many tasks and priorities. This application is most suitable for students who:

* have an endless number of tasks to keep track of
* are unable to monitor their tasks and their levels of importance
* prefer to use a desktop application
* prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Is PrioriTask the application for you? Get started by reading the
<<UserGuide#, user guide>> and <<DeveloperGuide#, developer guide>>.
