== PROJECT: Pigeons

---

== Overview

Pigeons is a desktop delivery planning application
used by delivery companies to plan for their delivery services effectively.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *use Google Map Distance Matrix API as the backbones to create optimized routes, to plan for trips*
** Application: apply to various parts of one of my minor enhancement(distance command) and one of my friend enhancement(filter command).
** Justification: This enhancement is used to calculate distance between locations,
providing data for us determine whether a specific address is exist or not. Then we can create the optimized route for the driver.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
Moreover, there are many more useful data that we can extract from the Distance Matrix such as estimated durations for different vehicles.
** Credits: Google Map Distance Matrix API for Java.

* *Major enhancement*: *created events to handle all possible cases related to the main display panel*
** What it does: load the needed route(s) on Google Map if possible(there is at least one existed address) or display errors on result display panel.
** Justification: This enhancement help the drivers visualising the locations on the map as well as show them possible routes and which are the optimized routes.
** Highlights: This enhancement is affected a lot by many existing commands and commands to be added in future.
Therefore, any future commands, which create events to change the display of the main display panel, require carefulness from the developer(s).

* *Minor enhancement*: added *Distance Command* to calculate distance from 2 locations so that the driver can plan his trip better.
