---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Insurance features
** What it does: Allows the user to add in multiple insurance plans that their client have subscribed to. It also allow the commission that the insurance agent receive from the particular insurance to be added in. Afterwhich, the insurance agent can also view the total commission gained from that particular client. User can also modify/delete the insurance or commission of a respective client by editing it directly.
** Justification: The main purpose of an insurance agent is to gain more client to subscribe for their insurance plan, as the number of client increase, it may get increasing difficult to handle data's of clients thus the need to organize information. With the use of reInsurance, insurance agent client will be more organized, resulting in more effort spent socializing with both existing clients and potential client so as to further expand their business.
** Highlights: The implementation of this feature prove to be challenging for the part where multiple component needs to be edited. Mainly the problem faced was to connect everything up together yet not breaking the application.
** Credits: Coding forums for the inspiration given and teammate for the support.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added alias command for most existing commands such as add, edit, redo, undo etc.
** Justification: To increase the efficiency of using the application, especially for experienced user.

* *Minor enhancement*: Color tagged some associated and common tags for easier grouping while ensuring a default color code for other tags.
