== PROJECT: VetterAppointments

== Overview

VetterAppointments is a desktop application used for managing a vet's clients, pets, appointments and staff. +

VetterAppointments aims to simplify the process of scheduling an appointment as well as managing the
people and animals under a vet. It does this by removing the clutter in traditional scheduling applications. +

The user interacts with the program through a Command Line Interface (CLI) via inputting commands. These
feature is supported by a beautifully crafted Graphical User Interface (GUI). Everything that can be done
by the commands can also be done by the mouse. +

VetterAppointments' GUI is built using JavaFX. The program is written in Java and has about 20kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: A collection of commands that supports the Pet component and Appointment component.

. Pet class containing: PetName, PetAge, PetGender and Tag classes.
. AddPetCommand
. DeletePetCommand
. AddAppointmentToPetCommand
. RemoveAppointmentFromPetCommand
. SortAppointmentCommand
. SortClientCommand
. SortPetCommand
. UnscheduleCommand

** Justification: +
The enhancements play a major role in VetterAppointments. It serves as the backbone in terms of adding
the required components so that the user can manage them. The features adds an important class to a program
targeted at vets, which are pets.

** Highlights: +
The design consideration when adding a major components was thoroughly thought-out. The components are
independent and are not coupled. A wrapper class was introduced to mark an association between a pet
and its owner. This will then be fed into an appointment object, which is the overheading class.

* *Minor Enhancements*: Adding command aliases so that commands will not be too lengthy for the user
to type. Several components and command features are classified as incremental minor enhancements.
