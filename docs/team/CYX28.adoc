== PROJECT: BizConnect Journal

---

== Overview

BizConnect Journal is a dedicated application catered to busy businessmen, especially those who travel a lot.
This app helps to manage their wide range of contacts, events and tasks. It also uses Command Line Interface (CLI)
as the primary source of input.

The contacts, events and tasks features are especially useful during exchanging of contacts during meetings
and networking sessions, keeping track of upcoming major events for businessmen to know their current schedules and
also to help them prioritise their tasks by keeping track of the pending tasks and their urgency respectively.
Besides that, the currency converter aims to facilitate the fast and accurate knowledge of the amount to change
without the need for a separate converter application.

A simple day-to-day life of a businessman can be packed with many schedules and having a single tool to manage
all their necessary work information makes things easier, and save them valuable time and effort.
With all these goals in mind, BizConnect Journal is developed to ease the management of the busy schedules of businessmen.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Task feature to facilitate *task management*

** *What it does*:
It allows the businessman to add, delete, edit, find tasks by name, list and clear tasks. Also, the task list is
default sorted by status (i.e. undone to done), due date in ascending order and priority level (high > medium > low).

** *Justification*:
This feature allows the management of task conveniently. It is especially useful when the businessman needs to quickly
note down any task, without the worry of missing out important details. Furthermore, edit and delete allows the
businessman to update any task details and remove any completed task respectively. This helps to keep the task list
up-to-date with the businessman's current schedule.

** *Highlights*: This feature allows tasks to be managed together with contacts in the same application. Also,
a more user-friendly task display enables the businessmen to quickly identify the incomplete tasks details,
hence helping to save precious time in their busy schedule.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a sort contacts by name command. It allows the businessman to easily find and view
multiple contacts spanning across different alphabets in sequential order.
