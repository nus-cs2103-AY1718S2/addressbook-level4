== Introduction

Welcome to *Human Resources Plus* (*HR+*)! HR+ is a free recruiting and talent management software designed for *campus recruiters* to achieve hiring success. HR+ streamlines your recruiting process, increases your productivity and helps you make more consistent and informed hiring decisions.
This guide provides you with everything you need to know about setting up and using various features of HR+ effectively as a campus recruiter. To enjoy the full benefits of HR+, you should be *comfortable using desktop applications* and *working with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*. If you can type fast, HR+ can get your talent management tasks done faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.

Interested? Navigate to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `HR.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for HR+.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 u/NUS y/2020 m/Computer Science g/4.93 j/Software Tester` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[TIP]
The command keywords and parameters are *case sensitive*.

[TIP]
There is a floating real-time parsing panel below the command box that shows parsed results before commands are executed. +
However, it only verifies that the command format is correct. Commands that are shown to be "valid commands" might not execute successfully. +
For example, when you use a correct `add` command format to add a duplicate student into HR+, the real time parser shows that it is a valid command but it will not be successfully executed.

[TIP]
If you want to hide the real-time parsing panel, press kbd:[Tab].

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to HR+ +

// end::interview[]

// tag::find[]
=== Locating persons by field: `find` `[since v1.2]`

Finds persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. +

Option 1: `find KEYWORD, [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Option 2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS] prefix/...`

****
These are the prefixes supported by the `find` command: +
1. Name -  `n/` +
2. Phone - `p/` +
3. Email - `e/` +
4. Address - `a/` +
5. University - `u/` +
6. Major - `m/` +
7. Job Applied - `j/` +
8. Comment - `c/` +

These are 3 types of features that are supported for the `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches your search keyword with exact keywords found in the fields of persons. +

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches your search keyword that is a fuzzy match with keywords found in the fields of persons. The fuzzy matching algorithm is based on the `Levenshtein distance (LD)` , which is a measure of the similarity between two strings. The threshold is set to `2` in HR+. This means that any keyword that is 2 characters different from the search keyword will be detected. If you are interested in finding out how the fuzzy match algorithm works, you can refer to the Java API on how this method is implemented.

3. Wildcard keyword match – Matches your search keyword with 3 types of wildcard support. You should substitute the keyword " example " with your desired keyword. +
• Wildcard "example" searches for field that contains keyword example
• Wildcard *example searches for field that ends with keyword example
• Wildcard example* searches for field that starts with keyword example

Search results are displayed in the application console. The format is: +
`TYPE OF SEARCH MATCH` +
`KEYWORD: (PREFIX)MATCHED KEYWORD` +

(PREFIX) - represents which field the matched keyword was in. +
****

The fuzzy search algorithm is implemented to cater to users that fit the following profiles: +
1. Unsure what they want to search for +
2. Aware of some patterns of the keywords but not the full keyword +
3. Prone to typos +

If you are certain that you want to find a certain keyword, please use the wildcard `"example"` so that all fields that contains the search keyword would be displayed only. Customizing fuzzy searching is one of our considerations for `v2.0`.

Examples: +

[TIP]
General tips are not repeated across different examples!

* `find bernice, charlot` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields are of an exact keyword match **OR** fuzzy keyword match with `bernice` **OR** `charlot`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Bernice Yu` and `Charlotte Oliveiro`. Keyword `bernice` is an exact keyword match with one of the keywords `Bernice` and `charlot` is a fuzzy keyword match with one of the keywords `Charlotte` in `Charlotte Oliveiro`.

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive in HR+. e.g `bernice` might match `Bernice`. +
Different keywords should be **comma separated**, if not it will be treated as one keyword in HR+. +
All fields are searched if no prefix is supplied **first** in HR+. If the first keyword does not **start** with a valid prefix, this command would assume a global search for **all** fields. A global search does an **OR** search between keywords. +
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned in HR+. +

* `find e/alexyeoh@example.com, lidavxx@example.com j/Software p/87438807` +
Returns list of persons that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords in their `email` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `alexyeoh@example.com` **OR** `lidavxx@example.com` **AND** +
2. Keywords in their `job applied` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `Software` **AND** +
3. Keywords in their `phone` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `87438807`. +
In the sample data provided, the list will return person `Alex` as he is the only person that matches all these conditions.

[TIP]
The first keyword is prepended with a prefix, thus this command assumes a prefix search. A prefix search does an **OR** search between keywords in the same prefix and an **AND** search between different prefixes. +

* `find Mohammed, Julius, n/test@example.com` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `Mohammed`, `Julius` **OR** `n/test@example.com`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Julius Hassange` and `Mohammed Lee`. +

[TIP]
The prefix is not accounted for in the third keyword as the first keyword does not **start** with a valid prefix.

* `find alex bernice david` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `alex bernice david`. In the sample data provided, this command will return an empty list.

* `find n/alex bernice david p/98293213 92421423` +
Returns list of persons that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords in their `name` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `alex bernice david` **AND** +
2. Keywords in their `phone` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `98293213 92421423` +
In the sample data provided, this command will return an empty list. +

[TIP]
Keywords are not comma separated, thus they are treated as one keyword.

* `find bernice, "alex", ir&ast;, &ast;li` +
Returns list of persons with **any** of their fields that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `bernice` **OR**
2. Field contains keyword `alex` **OR**
3. Field starts with keyword `ir` **OR**
4. Field ends with keyword `li` +
In the sample data provided, this command will return persons `Alex Yeoh`, `Bernice Yu`, `David Li` and `Irfan Ibrahim`. +

* `find n/bernice, "alex", ir&ast;, &ast;li e/&ast;example.com p/"5" m/Computer&ast;` +
Returns list of persons with matches the following conditions: +
1. `Name` field with keywords that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `bernice` **OR** contains keyword `alex` **OR** starts with `ir` **OR** ends with `li` **AND** +
2. `Email` field ends with keyword `example.com` **AND** +
3. `Phone` field contains keyword `5` **AND** +
4. `Major` field starts with keyword `Computer` +
In the sample data provided, the list with return person `Bernice` as she is the only person that matches all these conditions.


* `find berni, charlot, bernice, charlotte` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `berni` **OR** `charlot` **OR** `bernice` **OR** `charlotte`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Bernice Yu` and `Charlotte Oliveiro`. +

Below shows how the application console looks like when this command is executed:

****
Exact word search matches: +
charlotte: - +
charlot: - +
bernice: - +
berni: - +

Fuzzy search matches: +
charlotte: - +
charlot: (n/)Charlotte +
bernice: - +
berni: (n/)Bernice +

Wildcard search matches: +
****

[TIP]
When a search keyword matches a person first, subsequent search keywords that matches the same person would be reflected in the application console as `-`.
// end::find[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter persons by multiple fields: `filter` `[since v1.3]`

Filters persons whose keyword is within the specified range.
Format: `filter [y/KEYWORD_RANGE] [r/KEYWORD_RANGE]`

* Keyword is in the format of (1) `KEYWORD` or (2) `KEYWORD1 - KEYWORD2` or (3) a combination of (1) and (2) `KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2 - KEYWORD3, KEYWORD4`.
* Each keyword must be valid with respect to the preceding prefix.
* `filter` command will only be filtering based on the current view of the person list, instead of all the persons.
* Within each prefix, `filter` command will match all entries that satisfies at least one keyword range. You can think of an `OR` operator within the prefix.
* `filter` command will match all persons that only matches every prefixes. You can think of an `AND` operator between all prefixes.

Examples:

* `filter y/2020` +
