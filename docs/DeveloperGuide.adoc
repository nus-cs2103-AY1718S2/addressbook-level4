== Introduction
Welcome to Medeina! Medeina is a application designed to help veterinarians and their assistants to manage contacts and appointments. Medeina is a command-line based application, all actions can be done using only keyboard.
This developer guide aims to help new developers to get started with Medeina, and also serves as a reference for even experienced Medeina contributors.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

To successfully install and run Medeina, you'll need the following:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

To set up Medeina in your computer, follow these steps:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

To check if the setup is successful:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

Before you start contributing to Medeina, the following configurations are required:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The above diagram shows the relations between each subcomponents within the Logic component.

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -o 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete -o 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
// tag::UIcomponent[]
=== UI component

The following diagram displays the structure of the UI component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// end::UIcomponent[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The following diagram displays the structure of the Logic component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following diagram displays the structures of the commands in Logic component.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramUpdated.PNG[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Medeina's data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<PetPatient>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The following diagram displays the structure of the Storage component. +

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back;
* can save Medeina's data in `xml` format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::autocompleteDG[]
=== Autocomplete

The autocomplete feature serves to enhance user experience in using the Command Line Interface (CLI). It currently supports command words, options, prefixes, and parameters such as tags, NRIC, pet patient's name, breed, species, colour and blood type.

==== Current Implementation

The implementation logic of the autocomplete feature resides in the `UI` component. The autocomplete feature is driven by a `ChangeListener` attached to `commandTextField.textProperty()` in `CommandBox.java`. Once the `ChangeListener` registers any changes in the content of `commandTextField`, `triggerAutocomplete()` will be executed. +

Suppose that the user is launching Medeina. Before the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is ready, a `CommandBox` object will be initialized for the user to enter commands. The following diagram illustrates a sequence of method calls, starting with the initialization of `CommandBox`, followed by the initialization of an instance of `Autocomplete`, and then calling 3 set attribute methods in the `Logic` component. Subsequently, suppose the user has typed `add -p n/Happy s/Cat b/Persian c/Calico bt/A -o nr/`. The diagram shows a sequence of method calls, starting with triggerAutocomplete(), to get autocomplete suggestions for NRIC to be shown in a context menu.

.Sequence diagram for autocomplete feature
image::autocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
`Autocomplete.java` encompasses the logic for parsing user input in the CLI and determining what autocomplete suggestions are to be passed back to `CommandBox.java`. Data required for autocomplete, such as a list of command words, prefixes, options and parameters in Medeina, are retrieved from the `Logic` component. All data required by `Autocomplete` are consolidated in a similar way in the `Logic` component.

The following code shows how NRIC and tags from all `Person` objects are consolidated:
[source,java]
----
public void setAttributesForPersonObjects() {
    nricInModel = new HashSet<>();
    personTagsInModel = new HashSet<>();

    for (Person p : model.getAddressBook().getPersonList()) {
        nricInModel.add(p.getNric().toString());
        personTagsInModel.addAll(p.getTags());
    }
}

public Set<String> getAllNric() {
    return nricInModel;
}

public Set<String> getAllPersonTags() {
    Set<String> personTags = personTagsInModel.stream()
            .map(pt -> pt.tagName)
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    return personTags;
}
----

You may have noticed that in sequence diagram above (Figure 11), `Autocomplete` is a singleton class that is initialized only once, and there is only 1 instance of `CommandBox` in the application. You may be wondering "can the 3 set attribute methods in the `Logic` component be called only once?". If you are currently unsure, imagine that the user is constantly adding new contacts to Medeina. However, `Autocomplete` uses only data from when Medeina was launched. +

The answer to the question is definitely no. The set attributes methods have to be called whenever there is a change in Medeina's data, otherwise the autocomplete suggestions will not be up to date.

The following code snippet ensures that the data used by `Autocomplete` is kept updated.
[source,java]
----
public void handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent a) {
    init(this.logic); // calls the 3 set attributes methods
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(a, "Local data has changed, update autocomplete data"));
}
----

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Updating autocomplete data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All Data is updated only when `AddressBookChangedEvent` is raised.
** Pros: Efficient and with minimal redundant updates.
** Cons: Implementation is less straight-forward.
* **Alternative 2 :** Updates the specific required data e.g. NRIC, whenever autocomplete is triggered.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Redundant updates. Required data will remain the same, except only when add, delete, or edit commands are executed.
* **Alternative 3:** All Data is updated whenever autocomplete is triggered.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Many redundant data updates. Running for-loops in the `Logic` component for every character the user types, is resource-intensive.

===== Aspect: Event-driven or user-driven

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement change listener to automatically track user input and provide autocomplete suggestions.
** Pros: Great improvement in user experience, as Medeina has long and complex command syntax.
** Cons: Logic for handling caret position and command syntax parsing is complicated and can be prone to bugs.
* **Alternative 2:** User has to press a specific key e.g. tab to invoke autocompletion.
** Pros: Less logic to account for, and is thus easier to implement.
** Cons: User experience is compromised.

===== Aspect: Autocomplete scope
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Autocomplete works only for commands that require options and prefixes.
** Pros: Reduce unneccessary autocomplete suggestions.
** Cons: Additional implementation logic to handle checking of command input.
* **Alternative 2:** Autocomplete works for any user input as long as correct options and prefixes are specifed.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: A whitespace after a command that doesn't require options and prefixes e.g. `help`, will bring up a list of suggested prefixes. This may cause confusion for the user.
// end::autocompleteDG[]

===== Aspect: Expanding the autocomplete feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Include descriptions in autocomplete suggestions for options and prefixes
** Pros: Great improvement in user experience, as the autocomplete suggestions now serve as a brief overview of what each prefix and options are used for.
** Cons: Additional implementation logic to handle descriptions e.g. descriptions should not be added to user input in the command box.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep to just simple autocomplete
** Pros: No additional logic required.
** Cons: User experience is compromised.

// tag::addcommandDG[]
=== Add Command
This command creates new `Person`, `PetPatient` and `Appointment` objects to be added into Medeina.

==== Current Implementation
The add command involves a combination of options to differentiate between what objects are to be added. Command syntax required for adding the different objects are shown below. Take note that the command word has been omitted.

----
 (1) Person: -o n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS nr/NRIC
 (2) PetPatient: -p n/NAME s/SPECIES b/BREED c/COLOUR bt/BLOODTYPE -o nr/NRIC
 (3) Appointment: -a d/DATETIME r/REMARKS t/TYPE_OF_APPOINTMENT -o nr/NRIC -p n/PET_PATIENT_NAME
 (4) All 3 objects in one command: -o n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS nr/NRIC -p n/NAME s/SPECIES b/BREED c/COLOUR bt/BLOODTYPE -a d/DATETIME r/REMARKS t/TYPE_OF_APPOINTMENT
----

Syntax (4) is equivalent to syntaxes (1), (2), and (3), but with fewer parameters required. Syntax (4) is designed to increase efficiency for the user in using the CLI, by reducing typing of redundant parameters. The parsing of these 4 `add` command syntaxes is performed using regular expressions pattern matching in `AddCommandParser`. +

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of methods that occurs when adding a `PetPatient` object to Medeina.

.Sequence diagram for autocomplete feature
image::addCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

A `PetPatient` object must be assigned to an existing `Person` object. The `Person` object refers to a point of contact, which could be the owner of the pet patient, or a volunteer in-charge of the pet patient. This type of dependency is verified in `AddCommand.java`.

The follow code shows how dependency between `PetPatient` and `Person` object is verified before the `PetPatient` object is added to `Model` component:
[source,java]
----
private CommandResult addNewPetPatient() throws DuplicatePetPatientException, CommandException {
    person = getValidOwner(ownerNric);
    model.addPetPatient(petPatient);
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS_PETPATIENT, petPatient, person));
}

private Person getValidOwner(Nric ownerNric) throws CommandException {
    Person validOwner = model.getPersonWithNric(ownerNric);
    if (validOwner == null) {
		throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_NRIC);
    }
    return validOwner;
}
----

Dependencies for `Appointment` object is also verified in a similar way in `AddCommand.java`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Consolidating similar commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A single `add` command with options to differentiate objects to be added.
** Pros: It is intuitive for users to just remember just 1 `add` command. Greater flexibility in introducing "power" command like syntax (4).
** Cons: Complex implementation logic
* **Alternative 2:** 3 separate commands e.g. `addperson`, `addpetpatient`, `addappointment`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Requires syntax (4) to be implemented as a separate command. More commands for the user to remember.

==== Current Limitations
Currently, `add`  command uses up to 3 options in its syntax. The order of options must be preserved due to the use of regular expressions to match command syntax pattern. This differs from prefixes which have flexibility in ordering. As a result, the add command may be less intuitive for users.

Another thing to note is that, the syntax for adding an appointment takes in the NRIC of an existing contact and a pet patient name. The pet patient that is specified must be one that assigned under the contact. However, the adding of a new appointment does not account for cases in which a particular contact has pet patients sharing the same name. The `add` command will assign the new appointment for the pet patient which has a lower `index` in Medeina. A simple workaround for this problem, is to `edit` the pet patient name with slight variation to differentiate them e.g. "Happy1", "Happy2".

==== Future Work
The problem of multiple pet patient sharing the same name under a contact will be addressed in near future. The `add` command syntax can be modified to include an optional index to differentiate the pet patients without having to edit their names. Aside from this, further improvements can be made to simplify the command syntax of `add`.

// end::addcommandDG[]

// tag::editcommandDG[]
=== Edit Command

This command allows a user to edit `Person`, `PetPatient` and `Appointment` objects.

==== Current Implementation

Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction between the various classes upon invocation of the `edit` command.

.Sequence Diagram for Edit Command
image::EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

We examine the flow of events, starting when the command goes through `EditCommandParser` for parsing. The type of information provided by the user will be
identified through the use of regular expression `Pattern` objects. +

[source,java]
-----
private static final Pattern EDIT_COMMAND_FORMAT_PERSON = Pattern.compile("-(o)+(?<personInfo>.*)");
private static final Pattern EDIT_COMMAND_FORMAT_PET_PATIENT = Pattern.compile("-(p)+(?<petPatientInfo>.*)");
private static final Pattern EDIT_COMMAND_FORMAT_APPOINTMENT = Pattern.compile("-(a)+(?<appointmentInfo>.*)");
-----

For instance, if the user has keyed in `edit -p 1 nr/S1234567Z` (same command as in the sequence diagram), then through the matching of the `Pattern` objects,
we will know that the user intends to edit a `PetPatient` object, since it matches the pattern
 `-(p)+(?<petPatientInfo>.*)`. +

Depending on which case matches (refer to code snippet below), we will then call the relevant parsing method for the
information provided by the user. Following the example from above, since the user has supplied the `-p` argument,
further parsing of the information will be done in the `parsePetPatient` method.

[source,java]
-----
public EditCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    String trimmedArgs = args.trim();

    ...

    // Edit existing pet patient
    final Matcher matcherForPetPatient = EDIT_COMMAND_FORMAT_PET_PATIENT.matcher(trimmedArgs);
    if (matcherForPetPatient.matches()) {
        String petPatientInfo = matcherForPetPatient.group("petPatientInfo");
        return parsePetPatient(petPatientInfo);
    }

    ...

    // throws exception for invalid format
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE)
        );
}
-----

The further parsing of the information in `parsePerson()`, `parsePetPatient()` and `parseAppointment()` will require
the use of `EditPersonDescriptor`, `EditPetPatientDescriptor` and `EditAppointmentDescriptor` respectively to create
the final objects to be replaced in the corresponding lists located inside `AddressBook`. +

The descriptor objects are used primarily for the transfer of information to the corresponding `Person`, `PetPatient`
or `Appointment` object. +

Using the example as explained previously, a new `EditPetPatientDescriptor` object will be created, and the relevant
information is retrieved out. Since only `PREFIX_NRIC` is present (`nr/`), then only the `ownerNric` field in
`EditPetPatientDescriptor` will be set.

[source,java]
-----
public EditCommand parsePetPatient(String petPatientInfo) throws ParseException {

    ...

    EditPetPatientDescriptor editPetPatientDescriptor = new EditPetPatientDescriptor();
    try {
        ParserUtil.parsePetPatientName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setName);
        ParserUtil.parseSpecies(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_SPECIES))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setSpecies);
        ParserUtil.parseBreed(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BREED))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setBreed);
        ParserUtil.parseColour(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_COLOUR))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setColour);
        ParserUtil.parseBloodType(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BLOODTYPE))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setBloodType);
        ParserUtil.parseNric(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NRIC))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setOwnerNric);
        parseTagsForEdit(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_TAG))
                .ifPresent(editPetPatientDescriptor::setTags);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }

    ...

    return new EditCommand(index, editPetPatientDescriptor);
}
-----

The relevant descriptor will be passed over to `EditCommand` at the end of the function, as can be seen above. +

Within `EditCommand`, there are a few private variables specified. One of the key things to note is that we are using
an `enum` to identify the type of object that we are editing. After the relevant method is called for `EditCommand`,
the index, type and descriptor will be set in the created `EditCommand` object, as can be seen in the code snippet below.

[source,java]
-----
public enum Type { EDIT_PERSON, EDIT_PET_PATIENT, EDIT_APPOINTMENT };

private Index index;
private EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor;
private EditPetPatientDescriptor editPetPatientDescriptor;
private EditAppointmentDescriptor editAppointmentDescriptor;
private Type type;

private Person personToEdit; // original
private Person editedPerson; // edited
private PetPatient petPatientToEdit;
private PetPatient editedPetPatient;
private Appointment appointmentToEdit;
private Appointment editedAppointment;

...

public EditCommand(Index index, EditPetPatientDescriptor editPetPatientDescriptor) {
        requireNonNull(index);
        requireNonNull(editPetPatientDescriptor);

        this.index = index;
        this.editPetPatientDescriptor = new EditPetPatientDescriptor(
                                            editPetPatientDescriptor
                                            );
        this.type = EDIT_PET_PATIENT;
}
-----

After this stage, the descriptors are processed based on the type using a switch (not shown). For instance, since the
user is editing a pet patient, then using the index of the pet patient in the last shown list, the `PetPatient` object
to be modified will be retrieved. Using the information from the descriptor, a new `PetPatient` object will be created,
so that we can replace the edited object in the list of `PetPatients`. The modified fields will come from the
`EditPetPatientDescriptor` object, while the unmodified fields will come from the old `PetPatient` object, as can be
seen in the code snippet below.

[source,java]
-----
protected void preprocessUndoableCommandForPetPatient() throws CommandException {
    List<PetPatient> lastShownPetPatientList = model.getFilteredPetPatientList();

    if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownPetPatientList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PET_PATIENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }

    petPatientToEdit = lastShownPetPatientList.get(index.getZeroBased());
    editedPetPatient = createEditedPetPatient(petPatientToEdit, editPetPatientDescriptor);
}

private static PetPatient createEditedPetPatient(PetPatient petPatientToEdit,
                                                     EditPetPatientDescriptor editPetPatientDescriptor) {
    assert petPatientToEdit != null;

    PetPatientName updatedName = editPetPatientDescriptor.getName().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getName());
    Species updatedSpecies = editPetPatientDescriptor.getSpecies().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getSpecies());
    Breed updatedBreed = editPetPatientDescriptor.getBreed().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getBreed());
    Colour updatedColour = editPetPatientDescriptor.getColour().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getColour());
    BloodType updatedBloodType = editPetPatientDescriptor.getBloodType().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getBloodType());
    Nric updatedOwnerNric = editPetPatientDescriptor.getOwnerNric().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getOwner());
    Set<Tag> updatedTags = editPetPatientDescriptor.getTags().orElse(petPatientToEdit.getTags());

    return new PetPatient(
            updatedName,
            updatedSpecies,
            updatedBreed,
            updatedColour,
            updatedBloodType,
            updatedOwnerNric,
            updatedTags
    );
}
-----

Now that the relevant object has been created, it will go through a series of checks to ensure the validity of the data
that the user has keyed in. This will be detailed under the next section, <<Edit-Command-Design-Consideration-Dependency-Resolution>>. +

Finally, the relevant listing will be updated, so that the user can see the changes immediately in the Medeina
application. A success message will be returned if the command has been executed fully with no errors.

        switch (type) {
        case EDIT_PERSON:
            resolvePersonDependencies();
            model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);

Below is the activity diagram for `edit` command to give us a better insight on how all the above-mentioned operations work together.

.Activity Diagram for Edit Command
image::EditActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

===== Consolidating Similar Commands

Initially, we have considered having multiple commands for adding of `Person`, `PetPatient` and `Appointment` objects.
For example:

* Editing a Person: `editperson`
* Editing a PetPatient: `editpetpatient`
* Editing an Appointment: `editappointment`

However, implementing the logic this way will make typing very inefficient for users, since the commands are extremely long.
This defeats the main purpose of our CLI-centered application. +

As such, to make things simpler, and also more user friendly for our users, we have decided to consolidate these
3 variants into just one single command, with the use of an option to indicate which object the user is trying to edit. +

Below is the final command syntax for `edit` command after taking this into consideration:

* Editing a Person: `edit *-o* INDEX [n/CONTACT_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [nr/NRIC] [t/TAGS]...`
* Editing a PetPatient : `edit *-p* INDEX [n/PET_PATIENT_NAME] [s/SPECIES] [b/BREED] [c/COLOUR] [bt/BLOOD_TYPE] [t/TAGS]...`
* Editing an Appointment : `edit *-a* INDEX [d/YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [r/REMARK] [t/TAGS]...`

[[Edit-Command-Design-Consideration-Dependency-Resolution]]
===== Resolution of Dependencies

The problem with editing the various fields of an object is the breaking of dependencies that it might have with other objects. +

The various dependencies and / or other considerations are listed in the table below:

[cols="20, 80", options="header"]
|=====
| Object
| Dependency / Considerations

.^a|Person
a|* If editing name, phone, email, address: no problems posed.
* If editing person's NRIC: all pets and their respective appointments under specified person must also be modified (NRIC fields). Retrieve all pets and appointments with said NRIC and update accordingly.

.^a|PetPatient
a|* If editing species, breed, colour, blood type: no problems posed.
* If editing name: search for and update all related appointments.
* If editing owner's NRIC: Check if NRIC exists. If yes, search and update all relevant appointments. If no, throw an exception.
* If editing both name and owner's NRIC: Check if NRIC exists. If yes, search and update all relevant appointments. If no, throw an exception. Also, search for and update all related appointments under the specified pet's name.

.^a|Appointment
a|* If editing remark, type: no problems posed.
* If editing date and time of appointment:
** Check for clashes (existing appointment at that time slot).
** Check for concurrent appointments.
** Check whether stated date and time is in the past.
|=====

These dependencies are resolved within Medeina for our users' convenience. +

We will now show two notable examples of dependency resolution in Medeina.

====== Resolving PetPatient Dependencies with Name and Owner NRIC

Resolution of PetPatient dependencies is required when changing its name or its owner's NRIC. The code to resolve these
dependencies is as follows:

[source,java]
-----
private void resolvePetPatientDependencies() throws CommandException,
            AppointmentNotFoundException, DuplicateAppointmentException {

    Nric oldNric = petPatientToEdit.getOwner();
    Nric newNric = editedPetPatient.getOwner();
    PetPatientName oldPetName = petPatientToEdit.getName();
    PetPatientName newPetName = editedPetPatient.getName();

    if (!oldNric.equals(newNric)) { // nric edited, I want to change owner
        Person newOwner = model.getPersonWithNric(newNric); // new owner must exist
        if (newOwner == null) {
            throw new CommandException("New owner must exist first before updating pet patient's owner NRIC!");
        }
        // we only update nric for appointments for that specific pet patient!
        // this is because it might be an owner transfer. If there are some other pets under the previous owner,
        // he/she may still be holding on to these pets.
        updateAppointmentByOwnerNricForSpecificPetName(oldNric, newNric, oldPetName);
    }
    if (!oldPetName.equals(newPetName)) { // name edited
        updateAppointmentByPetPatientName(newNric, oldPetName, newPetName);
    }
}
-----

In the code snippet above, we note that a check has been done for whether the old owner's NRIC and the new owner's NRIC are
equivalent. If they are not, this tells us that the owner's NRIC has been changed, and we search through the list of Persons
to check if the new owner with the specified NRIC exists. If it exists, then we update all the appointments tied to the pet patient
to the new owner. +

If the new pet patient's name is not equivalent to the old pet patient's name, it means that the user has edited it, and hence
we update all appointments for the selected pet patient to be tied to the new pet patient's name as supplied by the user.

====== Checking for Concurrent Appointments

Checking for concurrent appointments is another key part of the `edit` command, where we have to ensure that appointments
do not overlap with each other. The relevant code for the checking for concurrent appointments is shown below:

[source,java]
-----
private void checkForConcurrentAppointments() throws ConcurrentAppointmentException {
    LocalDateTime oldDateTime = appointmentToEdit.getDateTime();
    LocalDateTime newDateTime = editedAppointment.getDateTime();

    if (model.hasConcurrentAppointment(oldDateTime, newDateTime)) {
        throw new ConcurrentAppointmentException();
    }
}

public boolean hasConcurrentAppointment(LocalDateTime oldDateTime, LocalDateTime newDateTime) {
    for (Appointment a : addressBook.getAppointmentList()) {
        LocalDateTime dateTime = a.getDateTime();
        if (newDateTime.isAfter(dateTime)
                && newDateTime.isBefore(dateTime.plusMinutes(30))
                && !dateTime.equals(oldDateTime)) {
            return true;
        }
        if (newDateTime.isBefore(dateTime)
                && newDateTime.plusMinutes(30).isAfter(dateTime)
                && !dateTime.equals(oldDateTime)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
-----

The main checking for concurrent appointments is done in the method `hasConcurrentAppointment()` within `ModelManager`.
We loop through the entire list of appointments, and check whether there is any overlap in timing for both before and after
every appointment in the list.

==== Current Limitations

As of now, we do not have a list for past appointments, and a separate list for future appointments. +

As such, this will make the looping through of the appointments as previously mentioned very slow, as more and more appointments are added to the list.

==== Future Work

One of the limitations that we want to address will be the separation of past and future appointments. This is for greater
efficiency when we loop through appointments for editing.

Also, as of now, pet patients only have the following fields: name, species, breed, colour, blood type, owner NRIC and tags.
It is our desire that Medeina be able to handle most of the tasks as required by veterinarians and their assistants, and
this will include the ability to view and update a pet patient's medical history so that Medeina can be an all-in-one
application for our users. As such, one of the key future improvements to the current `edit` command will be the ability to update a
pet patient's medical history. +

// end::editcommandDG[]


// tag::ListPets[]
=== Display List of PetPatients
==== Current Implemaentation
Since Veterinarians and their assistants have the need to view the PetPatients as a list and see how many PetPatients belong to the same Owner. It is necessary to implement the PetPatient List feature.

image::List_Command.PNG[width="500"]

==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1:** Use tab function to switch between PetPatientList and PersonList

** Pros: The UI will be neat to see, saves more space for calendar view
** Cons: The user will not be able to see both PetPatient and Owners at the same time.

* **ALternative 2:** Implement another Panel to display PetPatients.

** Pros: User will be able to see both lists at the same time
** Cons: Takes up more space, making it difficult to display appointments in the future.

==== Current Limitations
More command and features relating to PetPatient List are to be properly developed, the tags of PetPatients are not properly organised.

==== Future Work
Implement the corresponding Add, Delete, List commands for petPatients and decide on the tags to be used for petPatients.
// end::ListPets[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Show Appointments on calendar
==== Current Implementation

Since veterinarians and their assistants have the need to constantly check their schedule for upcoming appointments, a calender feature is required to show future appointments.

Third party API `CalendarFX` is used as a Java calendar frame to show Appointments.

image::Show_Appointments.png[width="650"]


==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1:** Use `iCalendar` from Jfxtra library

** Pros: Easy to implement, convenient to use. Can easily import from Jfxtra library.
** Cons: UI styles are limited, the API is limited;

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement CalendarFX API library.
** Pros: Versatile APIs such as set style for each calendar, and much better looking UI than iCalendar.
** Cons: Extra work required to integrate CalendarFX files into project, and may cause build problems if not implemented properly.

==== Current Limitations

There's a known issue in CalendarFx, when switch from a year with appointments inside to a year without, the CalendarFx will still color the same appointment data despite there's no entry on that date.

Users and developers should know that this issue is embedded inside CalendarFx, and hopefully can be resolved in future versions of CalendarFx.

==== Future Work
We may be able to make enhancements to the Medeina's UI such as changing theme colour to match the UI colour of CalendarFX.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::find[]
=== Finding a Contact or Pet Patient
The find function allows users to look for contacts or pet patients.

==== Current Implementation
As Medeina caters to veterinarians, there is a need to be able to search through heaps of data to find specific information. For example, users can search by contacts to find a particular `Person` through their `Nric`, or search by pet patients to find for possible blood donors through their `BloodType`.

The below diagram illustrates the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components in finding pet patients with a specific `BloodType`.

.Interaction between `Logic` and `Model` components upon running `find -p bt/B`.
image::FindPetPatientDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
`FindCommandParser.java` handles and separates user input based on a regular expression that captures the matching groups of options `-o` and `-p`. The results are then parsed into `ArgumentMultimap` which separates user input into accepted prefixes of `n/NAME`, `nr/NRIC` and `t/TAGS` for contacts (option `-o`), `n/NAME`, `s/SPECIES`, `b/BREED`, `c/COLOUR`, `bt/BLOOD TYPE` and `t/TAGS` for pet patients (option `-p`).

The keywords for each prefix found is then added as `String[]` into a `HashMap`, with a suitable `String` acting as a key for the values. A new `FindCommand` is created with the `HashMap` of all the keywords of all found relevant prefixes. Upon initialization of `FindCommand`, the type is determined (1 for contact, 2 for pet patient) based on the keys present in the `HashMap`.

In `execute()`, there is a switch that determines if the find is for contacts or pet patient, based on the found type. The commands `findOwner()` or `findPetPatient()` are called respectively. For each of the prefix, if it exists, a `Predicate` is created for it with its keywords. All of the prefixes add together through the `.and(...)` function to make one final `Predicate` that encompasses of all the prefixes.

[source, java]
----
private CommandResult findOwner() {
    Predicate<Person> finalPredicate = null;

    //... code for Predicate for name and nric ...

    if (hashMap.containsKey("ownerTag")) {
        String[] tagKeywords = hashMap.get("ownerTag");
        Predicate<Person> tagPredicate = person -> Arrays.stream(tagKeywords)
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getTagString(), keyword));
        if (finalPredicate == null) {
            finalPredicate = tagPredicate;
        } else {
            finalPredicate = finalPredicate.and(tagPredicate);
        }
    }

    model.updateFilteredPersonList(finalPredicate);
    updatePetListForOwner();
    return new CommandResult(getMessageForPersonListShownSummary(model.getFilteredPersonList().size())
            + "\n"
            + getMessageForPetPatientListShownSummary(model.getFilteredPetPatientList().size()));
}

----

The model then gets called via `updateFilteredPersonList(...)` or `updateFilteredPetPatientList(...)` together with the final predicate, as shown above.

.Listing of found pet patients and contacts of found pet patients after running the command `find -p s/Cat bt/B`.
image::FindPetPatientResult.PNG[width="800"]

{empty} +
As Medeina has both contacts and pet patients, it should be possible for users to see contacts of pet patients and vice versa. As such, a function is called after the update to reflect similar changes on the other panel. An exmple of the result obtained is shown above.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Improving search
* **Alternative 1:** Each additional prefix will be a `or`.
** Pros: Covers more ground, users can search for information with each individual prefix (i.e. `-o n/A nr/NRIC_NOT_A` will get both `A` and `NRIC_NOT_A`)
** Cons: Chance that too much information will be listed, making it too broad of a search for specific things.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Each additional function will be an `and`.
** Pros: More specific, users can search for specific information with the prefixes adding up (i.e. `-p s/Cat bt/B` searches for pet patients who are cats and have blood type B)
** Cons: Chance that the search is too specific, and will display no results (i.e. `-o n/A nr/NRIC_NOT_A` will not get anything as each contact only has 1 `Nric`)
//end::find[]
==== Current Limitations
Users are unable to find appointment related elements as the `Appointment` listing function in the calendar is different from the listing function of the other classes of `Person` and `PetPatient`. As such, there is currently no implementation to find an appointment based on types or remarks, which may pose as inconvenience to veterinarians, should they want to search by a specific type of appointment or remark.

==== Future Considerations
In the future, Medeina might consider adding functions that allow for finding of appointments by types or remarks, as well as update the calendar accordingly with the results of the find command.



// tag::listappt[]
=== Listing Appointments of Different Views and Dates
The command allows users to list appointments based on the date that they wish to see, and the results are displayed via the API of CalendarFX.

==== Current Implementation
After Medeina implemented CalendarFX, users are able to view appointments at a specified date by clicking on the Calendar. However, as Medeina is a CLI-based application, users should not be required to move their mouse. Instead, users should be able to jump to certain dates to check appointments using the command line only.

.Day view of the Calendar obtained by the `listappt -d` command.
image::ListAppointmentDayView.PNG[width="800"]

{empty} +
The implemented CalendarFX API consists of 4 different views: Day, Week, Month and Year views. Users should be able to get a specific requested view of a date, month, or year they wish to see.

The below diagram illustrates the interaction between the `UI`, `Logic` and `Events` components in the `ListAppointment` command.

.Sequence diagram for interactions between the different components upon running the `listappt -y 2017` command.
image::SDforListAppointment.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
`ListAppointmentParser.java` handles and separates the request of users based on a regular expression that captures the matching groups of options `-d`, `-w`, `-m` and `-y`. The parser then checks the remaining user input, and parses it into `LocalDate`, `YearMonth` and `Year` classes. Should there be no remaining user input after the option, the current date is obtained as the field. A new `ListAppointmentCommand` is created with the type (1 for year, 2 for month, 3 for week, 4 for date) as well as the parsed class.

In `execute()`, there is a switch that determines the type of command run based on the type obtained from the parser. The relevant functions to change the Calendar gets called based on the type, and an event gets called to handle the change. If an appointment is in the past, a check is done to determine whether there were appointments in the year of that requested date, so that users are not able to jump into years that should not have appointments (i.e. years before Medeina existed).

[source, java]
----
private CommandResult getYearView() throws NoAppointmentInYearException {
    if (year.isBefore(Year.now())) {
        if (!checkPastAppointment(year.getValue())) {
            throw new NoAppointmentInYearException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }

    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeYearViewRequestEvent(year));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, "year"));
}
----

An event is then called to handle change the view with the specified date. The handler resides in `CalendarWindow.java` to be able to switch the `calendarView` to the specified requested view.

[source, java]
----
private void changeWeekView(LocalDate date) {
    WeekFields weekFields = WeekFields.SUNDAY_START;
    int week = date.get(weekFields.weekOfWeekBasedYear()) - 1;

    if (week == 0 && date.getMonthValue() == 12) {
        //wraparound
        week = 52;
        calendarView.showWeek(Year.of(date.getYear()), week);
    } else if (week == 0 && date.getMonthValue() == 1) {
        //wraparound
        LocalDate dateOfFirstJan = LocalDate.of(date.getYear(), 1, 1);
        if (dateOfFirstJan.getDayOfWeek().getValue() != 7) {
            week = 52;
            calendarView.showWeek(Year.of(date.getYear() - 1), week);
        } else {
            week = 53;
            calendarView.showWeek(Year.of(date.getYear() - 1), week);
        }
    } else {
        calendarView.showWeek(Year.of(date.getYear()), week);
    }
}
----

As the week view in calendarFX is different from the obtaining the week of year in the original Java API, there was a need to switch the week `value` obtained from `LocalDate` to fit the week `value` in the Calendar. Above illustrates the snippet of code used to convert from the `value` of the week obtained from `LocalDate` to fit the Calendar.

Upon a successful listing, a `CommandResult(...)` class is called with a success message of the specified view.
//end::listappt[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Improving command usage
* **Alternative 1:** Use a fixed `date` field.
** Pros: Users only need to remember that a `date` in the format of YYYY-MM-DD is accepted for each `listappt` command.
** Cons: Users have to type more than required, especially for Year and Month views.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use a changing field: `Year` for Year view, `YearMonth` for Month view, `LocalDate` for Week and Day views.
** Pros: Users do not need to type redundant information. A Year view will be in the format of YYYY while a Month view will be in the format of YYYY-MM or MM (with automatically allocated current year).
** Cons: Users have to remember that Year view only accepts the year, while the Month view only accepts a year and month, or month. The Week and Day views will not accept just a year or year and month, but requires the specific date.

===== Aspect: Improving user productivity
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement functions that requires users to type to switch views instead of clicking
** Pros: Users do not need to switch between using a mouse and a keyboard, which increases productivity for users accustomed to the CLI based nature of Medeina.
** Cons: Need to implement functions that help will change views (`listappt` or `la` command).

* **Alternative 2:** Use buttons and clicks to switch a calendar than to manually input a command
** Pros: There will be no need to implement any functions pertaining to `ListAppointment`.
** Cons: Defeats the purpose of a CLI-based application.

// tag::delete[]
=== Deletion and Force Deletion of Contact, Pet Patient and Appointment
The delete function allows its users to get rid of obsolete information.

==== Current Implementation
Medeina has multiple important classes to handle: `Person`, `PetPatient` and `Appointment`. As Medeina caters to veterinarians, there is a need for the ability to remove the mentioned classes. For example, an `Appointment` can be deleted should a contact decide not to go for the appointment anymore, a `PetPatient` should be deleted if a pet patient dies, and a `Person` should be deleted if a contact decides to immigrate permanently.

The below diagram illustrates the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` components during the deletion of a contact.

.Interaction of `Logic` and `Model` Components through the `delete -o 1` command.
image::DeletePersonDiagramForDelete.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
`DeleteCommandParser.java` handles and separates the deletion based on a regular expression that captures the matching groups of options `-o`, `-p`, `-a`, `-fp` and `-fo`. Next, the parser gets the `Index` from user input to determine the element to delete. The parser then creates a new `DeleteCommand` with the type (1 for contact, 2 for pet patient, 3 for appointment, 4 for force contact, 5 for force pet patient), as well as the `Index`.

In `execute()`, there is a switch that determines the type of command run based on the type obtained from the parser. The normal delete functions (types 1, 2, 3) subsequently calls the `Model` component to properly remove the element.

[source,java]
----
private CommandResult deleteAppointment() {
     //... code ...
     requireNonNull(appointmentToDelete);
     model.deleteAppointment(appointmentToDelete);
     //... code ...
     return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_APPOINTMENT_SUCCESS, appointmentToDelete));
 }
----
However, for the force delete functions (types 4, 5), dependencies have to be removed before the element itself can be removed, as shown by the snippet of code from `DeleteCommand.java` below.

[source,java]
----
private CommandResult deleteForcePerson() {
    //... code ...

    List<PetPatient> petPatientsDeleted = model.deletePetPatientDependencies(personToDelete);
    List<Appointment> appointmentsDeleted = new ArrayList<>();
    for (PetPatient pp : petPatientsDeleted) {
        appointmentsDeleted.addAll(model.deleteAppointmentDependencies(pp));
        deleteDependenciesList += "\n" + (String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_PET_PATIENT_SUCCESS, pp));
    }
    for (Appointment appointment : appointmentsDeleted) {
        deleteDependenciesList += "\n" + (String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_APPOINTMENT_SUCCESS, appointment));
    }
    model.deletePerson(personToDelete);

    //... code ...

    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToDelete) + deleteDependenciesList);
}
----

It can be noted that pet patient dependencies are deleted before appointment dependencies. This is because of the dependency "hierachy" between the different elements. A pet patient is uniquely tied to a contact based on `Nric`, while an appointment is uniquely tied to a pet patient based on `Nric` and `PetPatientName`. As a result, pet patients must first be deleted before determining which appointments are to be deleted.

.Listing of relevant dependencies deleted upon a force deletion of a contact.
image::DeleteDependenciesForForce.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
For each dependency deleted, it is stored in `List<...>` so that the `CommandResult(...)` returns all deleted dependencies as well as the main, deleted element.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Improving user friendliness
* **Alternative 1:** Use different commands for different delete functions.
** Pros: It is easier to implement. The command can just take in an `Index` without any options before.
** Cons: Hard on users as they will have to type a different command for every type of delete (i.e. `deleteperson`, `deletepetpatient` etc.).

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use one overseeing `delete` command.
** Pros: Users do not need to go through the hassle of trying to remember every different command of delete.
** Cons: Extra work to determine the type of deletion (i.e. `-a` for Appointment, `-p` for PetPatient etc.).

===== Aspect: Ease of Use
* **Alternative 1:** Have no force delete function.
** Pros: There will be no need to implement functions to delete prior dependencies before a deletion is done. An exception can just be thrown if dependencies still exist.
** Cons: Users will need to manually find and delete every dependency manually.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Have a force delete function that will delete all dependencies along with the element to be deleted.
** Pros: Easier to use. Users do not need to manually find and delete all dependencies, it just gets deleted immediately if required.
** Cons: Need to delete dependencies upon calling a force function. In addition, the dependencies deleted must be shown as well to inform users of all deleted elements.
//end::delete[]

==== Current Limitations
As of now, users are only capable of deleting an element based on its `Index` displayed in Medeina. This may pose as difficult for users if they want to delete an element based on the list displayed through the `list` command, especially if there is alot of data in Medeina.

==== Future Considerations
In the coming future, the `Delete` function can be altered such that it allows users to input other fields other than just `Index`, so that users do not need to get a list before deleting a particular element, especially if the user wants to delete an element that is not in the current listing (i.e. not on the listing after a `find` command).


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of Medeina (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of Medeina before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in Medeina's address book. The current state of Medeina is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore Medeina to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores Medeina to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Medeina.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies Medeina (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of Medeina * and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Medeina depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in Medeina's address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Non Functional Requirements

.  The system should work on Windows, Linux and macOS as long as it has Java `1.8.0_60` or higher installed.
.  A user (vet or vet assistant) with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system administrative commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  The system should be accessible, even without any Internet connection (or with poor Internet connection).
.  The system should be able to hold the information of at least 1000 patients (pets) and their respective owners without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  The system should be stable (runs without crashing, even for extended hours) and responsive (with a maximum lag of 2 seconds) due to the possibility of patient emergencies.
.  The system should be reliable and accurate (i.e. information keyed in is guaranteed to be saved, information retrieved is guaranteed to be accurate based on what was keyed in previously).
.  The system must have sufficient security (such as password protection / encrypted storage file) to protect the confidentiality of the patients (pets) and their respective owners. This is also to ensure compliance with PDPA.
.  Patient's and owner's information should be easily and accurately backed up, with zero errors in the information.
.  Restoring patient's and their respective owner's information should be an easy process.
.  The system should have sufficient commands / functions to ensure that information can be maintained and managed easily. Basic operations such as add, delete, find, update must be included for patients and their respective owners.
