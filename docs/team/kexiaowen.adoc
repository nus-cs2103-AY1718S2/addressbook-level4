== PROJECT: HR+

---

== Overview

HR+ is a recruiting and talent management desktop application targeting University Talent Acquisition Specialists. It is built to help them manage a significant number of student contacts and find the best-fitting candidates. University Talent Acquisition Specialists interact with HR+ using a Command Line Interface(CLI). HR+ has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX and it is written in Java with approximately 33 kLOC.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *commands for users to manage ratings of a student after an interview*
** What it does: The `rate` command allows the user to evaluate a student's performance after an interview by assigning rating scores based on technical skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills and experience. The `rating-edit` command is used to edit the ratings of a student. The `rating-delete` command enables the user to delete the ratings assigned to a student.
** Justification: This feature is critical as it helps University Talent Acquisition Specialists track students' performance in interviews and decide whether or not to hire them.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves adding new commands to HR+. It requires a thorough understanding of the `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components and thus is challenging to implement.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `sort` command that allows the user to sort the current list of students in HR+ based on GPA, name or overall rating score in either ascending or descending order.

// tag::rate[]
=== Rating a student : `rate` `[since v1.1]`

Rates the student identified by the index number used in the last person listing based on technical, communication, problem solving skills and experience. +
Format: `rate INDEX t/TECHNICAL_SKILLS_SCORE c/COMMUNICATION_SKILLS_SCORE p/PROBLEM_SOLVING_SKILLS_SCORE e/EXPERIENCE_SKILLS_SCORE`

****
* Rates the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing. The index *must be a positive integer* such as 1, 2, 3, ...
* All four rating scores need to be supplied.
* The scores should be a number in the range of *1 to 5* (inclusive). Scores with more than two decimal places are rounded to *two decimal places*.
* The overall rating of a student is computed as the average of the four rating scores, rounded to two decimal places.
****

[TIP]
If you have rated the student, you will NOT be able to use the `rate` command on the same student again. Please use the `rating-edit` command to overwrite existing scores.

Examples:

* `rate 1 t/4.5 c/3 p/4 e/3.5` +
Rates the 1st person to have technical skills score of 4.5, communication skills score of 3, problem solving skills of 4, experience score of 3.5. The overall rating is computed to be 3.75.
* `rate 2 t/3 c/5 p/3.5 e/2` +
Rates the 2nd person to have technical skills score of 3, communication skills score of 5, problem solving skills of 3.5, experience score of 2. The overall rating is computed to be 3.38.
// end::rate[]

// tag::rating-edit[]

If you have not rated the student, please use the `rate` command to assign new rating scores.

Examples:

* `rating-edit 1 t/4.5 p/4 e/3.5` +
Edits the 1st person to have technical skills score of 4.5, problem solving skills of 4, experience score of 3.5.

Format: `rating-delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the rating of the applicant at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* such as 1, 2, 3, ...

* The sort order can only be `asc` (ascending order) or `desc` (descending order).
* When sorting the students based on name, cases are ignored when doing comparisons.
* If the list has been filtered, only current students on the list will be sorted instead of all students in HR+. If you intend to sort all the students in HR+, you may run the `list` command first.
****

Examples:

* `sort rating o/asc` +
Sorts the current list of students according to their overall rating in ascending order.
* `sort gpa o/desc` +
Sorts the current list of students according to their grade point average in descending order.

=== Rate Command
==== Current Implementation
The `rate` command allows Talent Acquisition Specialists to evaluate candidates' performance in interviews against four specific criteria, namely technical skills, communication skills, problem solving skills and experience. The format of this command is `rate INDEX t/TECHNICAL SKILLS SCORE c/COMMUNICATINO SKILLS SCORE p/PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS SCORE e/EXPERIENCE SCORE`.

In our current implementation, the `rate` command inherits from the `UndoableCommand` class. Two components, `Logic` and `Model`, are involved in the execution of this command. The `Logic` component is responsible for parsing user inputs while the `Model` component deals with updating of filtered person list.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how these two components interact when the `rate` command is executed:

image::RateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.1.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `rate` command

As shown above, execution of the `rate` command comprises the following steps:

. `LogicManager` invokes `parseCommand` method of `AddressbookParser`, taking user inputs as arguments.
. During the `parseCommand` method call, an instance of `RateCommandParser` will be created when the keyword "rate" is matched. `RateCommandParser` then extracts the remaining user inputs and a `RateCommand` instance `r` will be returned provided that the format of user's input is correct.
. `LogicManager` then calls `executeUndoableCommand` of the `RateCommand`, `r`, instantiated in step 2. Another component, `Model`, will be involved as the `RateCommand` requests to update the rating scores of the person.
. The `Model` component gets the filtered persons list and replaces `Person` p1 with `Person` p2 which is identical to p2 except rating scores. A `CommandResult` will be generated and returned to `LogicManager`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of adding and editing rating scores

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a new command class `RateCommand` that supports adding rating scores and `RatingEditCommand` to handle editing of rating scores
** Pros: Results in more customisable commands that can be easily modified to support more prefixes and additional rating criteria
** Cons: Complicates the system as users need to familiarise themselves with more commands
* **Alternative 2:** Extend the original `EditCommand` to allow it to add and modify rating scores of a student
** Pros: Minimises the number of commands users have to remember to execute tasks, making the application more user-friendly
** Cons: Requires substantial changes to `EditCommandParser` and hence harder to implement
// end::rate[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Command
==== Current Implementation
The `sort` command supports the listing of students in HR+ based on GPA, name or overall rating in ascending or descending order as specified by the user. The format of this `sort` command is `sort FIELD o/SORT ORDER`.

As sorting is not undoable, this command inherits from the `Command` class instead of the `UndoableCommand` class. The sorting mechanism is mainly facilitated by `Logic` and `ModelManager`. `SortCommandParser` residing in `LogicManager` processes user inputs and creates a corresponding `SortCommand`. `ModelManager` will then invoke appropriate sorting methods in `UniquePersonList`.

The following sequence diagrams depict the interactions between `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` when a user issues a request for sorting:

image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence diagrams for execution of `sort` command

As seen from the sequence diagram above, `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` interact in the following way:

. When a user keys in `sort gpa o/desc`, `LogicManager` calls method `parser` in `AddressBookParser`.
. `SortCommandParser` is instantiated. If the user input is of the correct format, a `SortCommand` will be successfully created and returned back to `LogicManager`. Suppose the inputs are not valid or the format of the command is invalid, an exception will be thrown and users will see an error message.
. `LogicManager` proceeds to invoke `execute` method of `SortCommand`.
. `ModelManager` is in charge of sorting the list of persons through calling relevant methods provided in `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonList` according to the field to be sorted by.

Currently, HR+ only allows users to sort the list of students by selected fields in ascending or descending order. This is achieved by encapsulating acceptable sorting orders and fields into `SortOrder` and `SortField` of the type `enum` respectively.

In order to make Person objects comparable, additional methods need to be implemented in the `Person` class to compare different `Person` objects based on GPA, name and rating scores. The following code snippet demonstrates how these methods are implemented:
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Compares the overall ratings of two {@code Person} objects.
 * @param p1
 * @param p2
 * @return 1 if p1 has a higher overall rating, 0 if p1 and p2 have equal overall rating and -1 otherwise.
 */
public static int compareByOverallRating(Person p1, Person p2) {
    return Double.compare(p1.getRating().getOverallScore(),
            p2.getRating().getOverallScore());
}
----

To sort the list based on a particular field, we used the `sort` method from Java's `Collections` library. An example usage is shown below:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Sorts the list based on GPA in ascending order
 */
public void sortPersonsGradePointAverageAsc() {
    Collections.sort(internalList, Person::compareByGradePointAverage);
}

/**
 * Sorts the list based on GPA in descending order
 */
public void sortPersonsGradePointAverageDesc() {
    Collections.sort(internalList, Person::compareByGradePointAverage);
    Collections.reverse(internalList);
}
----

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: Implementation of `SortCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a more generic `SortCommand` that sorts the list of students based on parameters supplied by the user
** Pros: It is easier to modify `SortCommand` to support more fields to be sorted by.
** Cons: It restricts the format of sort command to be the same and is thus less flexible.
* **Alternative 2:** Use separate commands for each possible field, such as `gpa-sort`, `rating-sort` and `name-sort` commands
** Pros: It allows developers to specify different command formats. For example, users might not need to specify the sorting order explicitly. `rating-sort` and `gpa-sort` can have default sorting order to be descending while results from `name-sort` can be in ascending order.
** Cons: It increases the number of commands in HR+ and might be less user-friendly as users need to familiarise themselves with more commands.
