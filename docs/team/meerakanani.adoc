== PROJECT: Pigeons

---

== Overview

Pigeons is a desktop level application created for delivery companies to better assign and
organize deliveries for the delivery people.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to create an optimal delivery route when filtering the data
 by delivery date*
** What it does: allows the user to filter all the data by date of delivery and then creates an optimized route from the headquarters to all the delivery points for that day.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user is meant to be someone who delivers packages and this make it easy for the user to determine where he has to go that day and what the best route is from his
starting location. This optimized route will be outputed as a map on the UI by another team member.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands but more importantly required creating new classes and methods that
could be referenced by other team members and would be usable for the UI.
** Credits: The Google API was used to get the distance between addresses, the java code was written around using this API.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a filter command that allows the user to filter the data by date (delivery date).

* *Minor enhancement*: added a getTime function that gets the time of the entire journey for the delivery man and can be displayed on the UI.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T16-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/meerakanani10.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T16-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/meerakanani10.md[Test code]]

* *Other contributions*:

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Filtering person by date: `filter`

Filers the list of people by date (only one date)
Format: `filter DATE`

****
* Recommended date format is YYYY-MM-DD
****

When you filter by date the back end of the program will create an optimized route
for all the people on that date and display the route on the map.
****
* The search can only look for one date
* Persons with the delivery date matching the argument will be returned
* This filter can be used to obtain a delivery route for a day
****

== User Testing

When testing and using our system for the first time, here are some commands you can try to get the full experience.
Feel free to try other commands outlined above when you get the feel of our program as well.

*1.* add n/John Doa a/321 Clementi Ave p/67340028 e/pigeonscs2103@gmail.com d/2018-03-24
****
* John Doa should be added to the list of addressees.
****

*2.* filter 2018-03-24
****
* All addressees with 2018-03-24 in their delivery date should be listed.
* Additionally, a map routing all the shown addressees should be generated.
****

*3.* find John
****
* All addressees with John in their name should be listed.
****

*4.* delete 1
****
* John, which we added at the start, should be removed.
* 1-index numbering system (i.e. the first addressee has index 1)

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

=== Filter Command
To add to the many commands necessary for users, filtering by date will be essential when trying to optimize the route per day.
The filter command was added similar to how the find command has been implemented.
When the user enters filter by a date in the UI the model with the list of data is updated using the date predicate.
This updated model is then executed via the CommandResult class and output on the UI. It is stores as a readonly list in the model.

=== Route Optimization feature
Since this program is meant for deliveries the route for the daily delivery must be optimized for the user.
The RouteOptimization class will get the distance (getDistance function in GetDistance class) between all the addresses for the day.

The addresses will then be sorted based on optimal sortest route.
Example:
3 deliveries for a day at Point A, B, C

Point A --> Point B = 14km (12min)
Point A --> Point C = 13km (13min)
Point C --> Point B = 12km (10min)

Optimal Route = Point A --> Point C --> Point B (based on least about of km travelled)

In the RouteOptimization class the sorting function will be responsible to determine the optimal route once the distances are obtained

To getDistance - google API is required to get the geocodes for the locations. Once the geocode for each address is obtained
the distance between the two points is calculated and a matrix is returned with a distance property.
The distance property gives the distance in kilometers from the origin to destination.

The optimized route will the be fed into a mapping function to display the route and get the directions for the driver.

==== Sorting addresses
Once the distances have been found for all combinations of addresses on that filtered day they get stored in a Map with key: "address1_address2" and
value: Double distance (in km). This hashmap gets sorted in order of distances and any irrelevant or duplicate calculations are removed.
This sorted Hashmap now contains the key with the orign and destination address as well as the distance between the two.

Coming soon - If the first key is A_B then the second key must be B_X where X is the address closest to B (not including A). Based on this logic a list of addresses
will be created as the optimum delivery route.
