== PROJECT: BizConnect Journal

---

== Overview

BizConnect Journal is a dedicated application catered to busy businessmen, especially those who travel a lot.
This app helps to manage their wide range of contacts, events and tasks. It also uses Command Line Interface (CLI) as the primary source of input.

Businessmen tend to have a lot of meetings and networking sessions with new people which includes the exchange of contacts,
thus the above features will be useful for them as they can access all of them in one application without the trouble
of a separate application for each individual purpose.

At any point in time, the businessman can refer to the calendar and its event list to keep track of upcoming major events, thereby allowing a clear idea on
what his current schedule is like. In addition, the task list comes in handy to update the businessman of pending tasks and the tasksâ€™ urgency.
This helps them prioritise what needs to be done first.

Besides that, traveling in foreign countries also involves the hassle of not knowing the appropriate amount of money to change.
Hence, the currency converter aims to facilitate the fast and accurate knowledge of the amount to change without the need of a separate online converter application.

A simple day-to-day life of a businessman can be packed with many schedules and having a single tool to manage
all their necessary work information makes things easier, as well as save them valuable time and effort.
With all these goals in mind, BizConnect Journal is developed to ease the management of the busy schedules of businessmen.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Picture feature to facilitate *networking and contact management*

** *What it does*:
It allows a businessman to add or remove a profile picture for a contact.

** *Justification*:
By default, a contact has a default picture displayed. A user can then choose to display a picture alongside
the contact.

As a businessman is expected to meet a lot of people, chances are that he/she would not be able to recognize someone
by name only. A picture would help with this.

A user is then given the option to remove a picture by resetting it to the default picture again.

** *Highlights*: This enhancement interacts with the system's file storage. Therefore, an in depth study of the related APIs
was required to ensure the functionality of this feature

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a delete by name command. This allows a user to delete a contact by name, other than by index.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a add tag command. This allows a user to add individual or multiple tags to a contact.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T15-B4/main/tree/master/collated/functional/dezhanglee.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T15-B4/main/tree/master/collated/test/dezhanglee.md[Test code]]
