=== Common Usage

==== Saving the data

There is no need to save anything manually as My Team Manager will save
any data entered directly to the hard drive.

// tag::autocomplete[]
==== Tab Autocomplete

After typing in the first few characters of a command, pressing kbd:[tab] will fill in the rest of the item.

To view the parameters for a command, press tab after the whole command is typed in. Pressing tab again will remove the parameters.

[TIP]
You can use the autocompleted parameters as a template after viewing them.

Text will turn red if the input has no parameters or if no matching command exists.

If there are multiple possible commands for a given input, i.e. 'e' could be 'edit', 'exit', or 'export',
then a dropdown box will appear with the possible commands. These can be navigated using mouse or arrow keys. Press enter to select the desired command.
// end::autocomplete[]

Format: `redo` +
Alias: `r`

====
Previously executed `undo` command will be reversed and MTM will be in its previous state.
====

Here are a few valid examples on how you can use the `redo` command:
