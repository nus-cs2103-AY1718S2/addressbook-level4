* It is a Java application targeted for small-medium restaurants who wish to have an independent food-ordering and delivery-managing system.
* It is written in OOP fashion. The code base is reasonably well-written and is significantly big (around 6 KLoC)
* Contains support for Build Automation using Gradle and for Continuous Integration using Travis CI.
