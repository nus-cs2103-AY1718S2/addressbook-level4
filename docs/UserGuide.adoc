== Introduction

// tag::applicationDescription[]
*<<ReciRecipe,ReciRecipé>>* is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes*. More importantly, ReciRecipé is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (<<CLI,CLI>>) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (<<GUI, GUI>>).
// end::applicationDescription[]
If you can type fast, ReciRecipé can get your recipe management done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick start

[TIP]
You can use kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[F] to search for words in the user guide.

To start using ReciRecipé, please follow the steps below carefully.

.  Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0_60 or later installed in your Computer. You can download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest _recipebook.jar_ link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Recipe Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds (refer to Figure 1).

== Features

// tag::command-format[]
[[CommandFormat]]
*Command Format*

* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user. For example, in `add name/NAME calories/CALORIES`, *_NAME_* and *_CALORIES_* are parameters which can be substituted in this manner *`add name/Chicken rice calories/500`*.
** *_INGREDIENT_* is a list of ingredients, delimited by commas. E.g. `chicken,fish,rice` and `chicken, fish, rice` are valid.
** *_INSTRUCTION_* can receive multiple lines as its value.
** *_TIME_* fields accept a number of formats: `1h20m`, `1h20min`, `1 hour 20 minutes`, `80m`, `80min`, `80 mins`, etc. However, sticking to the most simple format `80m` is recommended.
** *_CALORIES_* and *_SERVINGS_* are positive numbers. E.g. `120`, `5000`, etc.
** *_URL_* takes a valid website address as its value. E.g. `http://google.com`.
** *_IMAGE_* takes a valid image path as its value (E.g. for macOS: `/Users/administrator/Desktop/image.png`, for windows: `C:\Users\admin\image.png`). Or it can also be a valid image URL, for example, `https://i.imgur.com/FhRsgCK.jpg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as *`name/Chicken rice tag/chicken`* or as *`name/Chicken rice`*.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), *`tag/rice`*, *`tag/rice tag/chicken`*, etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `name/RECIPE_NAME instruction/INSTRUCTION`, `instruction/INSTRUCTION name/RECIPE_NAME` has the same effect.
