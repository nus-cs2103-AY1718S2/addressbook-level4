== Introduction

Flashy is a desktop app for managing flashcards. It is built with the language learner in mind, but should be helpful for any student. Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

.  Here are some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tags and cards
* **`addc`**`f/Front b/Back t/tag1 t/tag2` : adds a flashcard with front as `Front` and back as `Back`, tagged with `tag1` and `tag2`.
* **`deletec`**`3` : deletes the 3rd flashcard in the visible list
* *`exit` or `quit`* : exits the application

Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter down the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.

Cards can have multiple tags.

Again. I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer 1` +
Pass. I kind of know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer 2` +
Easy. Easy A+. Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.
