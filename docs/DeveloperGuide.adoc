== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.flashy.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagramBW.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B4/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams/WhiteBlackDiagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletec 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteCardBW.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `CardBankChangedEvent` when the Card Bank data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteCardEventHandlingBW.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CardBankParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogicBW.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the flashcard data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the flashcard data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.flashy.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the application (e.g. `addc`, `editc`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the application before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `deletec 5`, to delete the 5th person in the application. The current state of the application is saved before the `deletec 5` command executes. The `deletec 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `addc f/What is ...` to add a new card.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the card was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the application to the state before the `addc` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the application to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagramBW.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramBW.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire application state.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies data (`add`, `addc`, `addm` `clear`, `edit`, `editc`, `editm`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the application and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::themesupport[]
=== Support for multiple themes

To allow the user to personalize their experience with Flashy, we have decided to add support for multiple themes. The architecture of this functionality has been designed to allow for maximum extensibility. Should you wish to add more themes to Flashy, simply duplicate and modify one of the existing CSS files. After that, modify the list of accepted themes in `UiManager.java` and the theme will be supported. This is the current list of supported themes:

....
public class UiManager extends ComponentManager implements Ui {
    public static final String[] VALID_THEMES = {"light", "dark"};

    // ...
}
....

These theme strings map into the following CSS files in `ChangeThemeCommand`:

....
public class ChangeThemeCommand extends Command {
    private final String[] themeStrings = {"view/LightTheme.css", "view/DarkTheme.css"};

    // ...
}
....

==== Current Implementation

The current implementation uses a single CSS file per designated theme. Flashy will load the selected theme dynamically. <<fig:changeThemeDiagram>> illustrates the sequence diagram for the theme changing functionality:

[[fig:changeThemeDiagram]]
.Sequence diagram for `theme`
image::ChangeThemeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Supporting dynamically switchable themes
* **Alternative 1**: Do not support dynamic switching, ship a separate version for each theme.
** Pros: Consistent user experience with a single theme.
** Cons: No ability to customize the look and feel of the application on the fly.
* **Alternative 2**: Support dynamic switching of themes.
** Pros: Users get a certain extent of customizability in the application.
** Cons: More development effort needed to support multiple themes and ensure that they can be loaded.

// end::themesupport[]

// tag::autocompletion[]
=== Autocompletion
We built Flashy with an autocompletion feature to save the user the trouble of memorising the parameters of all the possible commands supported by the application. At present, autocompletion is invoked by pressing the `TAB` key after entering a valid command.


==== Current Implementation

All autocompletion-related computation is done in the `Autocompleter` class. It abstracts the logic of validating the eligibility of autocompletion and generating the autocompletion text into two publicly-exposed APIs, as shown in this compressed code segment:

....
public class Autocompleter {
    public static String getAutocompleteText(String input) {
        // ...
    }

    public static Boolean isValidAutocomplete(String input) {
       // ...
    }
}
....

The upon pressing `TAB`, the `CommandBox` first checks with `Autocompleter` to see if it is a valid command. If it is valid, it then generates an autocompletion text for `CommandBox` to be updated with. <<fig:autocompleteActivityDiagram>> contains a visual representation of the workflow.

[[fig:autocompleteActivityDiagram]]
.Activity Diagram for the autocompletion workflow
image::autocompletion_ActivityDiagram.png[width="450"]

==== Supporting autocompletion in future commands

Should you develop more commands in the future, you can let your command support autocompletion by following these steps:

1. Declare `COMMAND_WORD` and `PARAMS` in your class.
+
....
public class NewCommand extends Command {
    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "command word here";
    public static final String PARAMS = "parameters here";
    // ...
}
....
+
2. Include your command's class in `Autocompleter`.
+
....
private static List<Class<? extends Command>> getCommandClasses() {
    List<Class<? extends Command>> commands = new ArrayList<>();

    // Must be added in increasing specificity so that add is not
    // overridden by addc, for example.
    commands.add(NewCommand.class);
}
....

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Storage of command and parameters

The commands and parameters used by `Autocompleter` need to be stored somewhere accessible at runtime so that it can validate and generate autocompletion text.

* **Alternative 1**: Hardcode commands and parameters in `Autocompleter` itself.
** Pros: This is easy to implement. Simply hardcode the command words and parameters within the `Autocompleter` class.

** Cons: Doing so requires the class to be updated whenever any command words or parameters change.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice)**: Dynamically poll each command class for their command words and parameters at runtime.

** Pros: Once this is implemented, there is no longer any need to modify `Autocompleter` 's code. Any changes made in the command class code is automatically reflected in `Autocompleter`.

** Cons: This is a little more challenging to implement. It accessing class parameters at runtime with strings require the use of advanced Java features such as the reflection libary.

// end::autocompletion[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name,
logging level) through the configuration file (default:
`config.json`).


//tag::cardtag[]
=== Card-Tag Association
This section describes the implementation details on how we model the
association between flashcards and tags.

The modeling of relations between flashcards and tags is crucial to
Flashy, because this is the primary mode of content organization in
the application. Henceforth, we will use the term "edge" to refer to a
relation between a flashcard and a tag.

==== Design Requirements
The software requires that:

1. A card can be associated with many tags. For example, a card with a
Physics question may be added to the "Physics" tag, and the "Midterm
2018" tag.

2. A tag can be associated with 1 or more cards. For example, The "Physics"
tag may contain many Physics flashcards on different topics. We enforce that
a tag must have at least one card, because a tag without cards is not useful
and can be removed.

This relationship is illustrated in <<CardTagRelation>>:

[[CardTagRelation]]
.Class diagram describing association between flashcards and tags.
image::Card_Tag_relation.png[width="450"]

==== Current Implementation
Edges are stored in an instance of `CardTag`. `CardTag` is an
association class, containing two `HashMap`s, as illustrated in <<fig:cardTagCD>>.

[[fig:cardTagCD]]
.Class Diagram illustrating relation between `Card`, `Tag` and `CardTag`
image::cardTag_ClassDiagram.png[width="450"]


[CAUTION]
Note that `CardTag` is only weakly associated to `Card` and `CardTag`. In particular, it stores the string representation
of the IDs of `Card` and `Tag` objects. This can lead to inconsistent states: for example, it is valid code-wise to have `CardTag`
to contain IDs of `Tag` and `Card` objects that have been deleted. Defensive programming is added to ensure that their states are consistent and valid.

Similar to `UniqueCardList` and `UniqueTagList`, only one instance of `CardTag` exists in each
`CardBank`.

==== Exposed APIs
Interaction with the `CardTag` instance is performed through the
`Model`. The model exposes 3 main methods for creating and removing
new edges:

....
public interface Model {
    // ...

    /** Gets list of tags for a given card */
    List<Tag> getTags(Card card);

    /** Removes the tags for a card */
    void removeTags(Card card, Set<Tag> tags) throws EdgeNotFoundException, TagNotFoundException;

    /** Adds the tags for a card */
    void addTags(Card card, Set<Tag> tags) throws DuplicateEdgeException;
}
....

These three APIs are sufficient for Flashy's design requirements as of
version 1.5. While the choice of APIs require some logic to be placed
in the commands (such as `AddCardCommand` and `EditCardCommand`), they
are reusable and their implementations can be easily changed.

The sequence diagrams for `addTags` and `removeTags` are shown in <<fig:addTags>>
and <<fig::removeTags>> respectively. In particular, it is important to note that:

- During an `addTags` operation,
  * The tags will be created if they do not exist
  * `DuplicateEdgeException` is thrown when the flashcard is already associated with the tag

- During a `removeTags` operation,
  * `TagNotFoundException` is thrown when the tag is not found in the card bank
  * `EdgeNotFoundException` is thrown when the flashcard and tag are not associated


[[fig:addTags]]
.Sequence Diagram for `addTags`
image::addTags_SQ.png[width="800"]

[[fig:removeTags]]
.Sequence Diagram for `removeTags`
image::removeTags_SQ.png[width="800"]
==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Storage of Edges

The edges should be persisted in storage. Hence, the `CardTag`
association class must be serializable to `xml`. This limits the
design choices for `CardTag`.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Add UUIDs to Cards and Tags, and
model edges as UUID pairs.

  - Pros: This allows the `CardTag` instance to be easily, and cheaply
   serialized to and from `xml`. Reduces coupling between the `Card` and `Tag` class.

  - Cons: Requires the addition of a UUID field to the `Card` and
    `Tag` class. Developer needs to be careful with implementation,
    because UUID strings for `Card` and `Tag` are indistinguishable.
    The additional code complexity is a result of storage being through serialization and
    deserialization of xml, and should be greatly reduced if a proper relational database
    and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool were used (planned in v2.0).

* Alternative 2: Store the edge information in `Card` and `Tag`.

  - Pros: No need for additional UUID field. Lower estimated code complexity.

  - Cons: Strong coupling between the `Card` and `Tag` class. Requires
  heavy duplication of content in storage. The developer will also have
  to be careful with the implementation: editing an object would require
  changes in both the `Card` object and `Tag` object.


===== Aspect: Choice of Data Structure

The application requires the following two operations to be fast:

1. Getting all `Card` instances from a specific `Tag` (operation 1)
2. Getting all `Tag` instances from a specific `Card` (operation 2)

Adjacency lists provide much better performance -- `O(1)` on both
operations, as compared to an adjacency matrix. In addition, a typical
`CardTag` graph is sparse, and adjacency lists are much more memory
efficient. Hence, the adjacency list is a natural choice.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Storing edges in 2 `HashMap`s:
  `cardMap` and `tagMap`.

  - Pros: `O(1)` for both operations.
  - Cons: Double the memory requirements.

* Alternative 2: Storing edges in 1 `HashMap`:
  `cardMap` or `tagMap`.

  - Pros: Uses minimal amount of memory.
  - Cons: `O(1)` only for one operation.

//end::cardtag[]

//tag::spacedrepetition[]
=== Scheduling, Answering and Showdue
The core component of how spaced repetition works is that it keep tracks of how
good the user is with a certain card. Our scheduling algorithm is an implementation
of the well known SM2 algorithm used by Supermemo, another flashcard app.

The main idea of how this is done is to keep a score of how good a user is with a certain card, a `Schedule` class is created.
Each card has its own `Schedule` object. There are some functions to allow the user to update
the score of the card after each time the user has answered it.

There are many possible ways how this could have been implemented.
However this document will try to walk you through the most difficult parts and talk about some note worthy mentions.

[CAUTION]
The `Schedule` object in each card is different from the `ScheduleCommand`

To interface with this Schedule object, `answer`, `schedule` and `showdue` command has been added.

* `answer`
** Answers the card and update a score
** This also set date for future review.
* `schedule`
** Allows one to manually set review date
* `showdue`
** Show cards due by a certain date to allow for effective studying.

==== Spaced Repetition Implementation
Schedule is implemented as an object in a Card.

Schedule contains a `java.time.LocalDateTime` which can be used to filter and order the cards.
`showdue` uses `LocalDateTime` to filter out and sort cards that are due by a certain date.

The `feedbackRouterHandler(int confidenceLevel)` function is the main part making the whole Scheduler system work.
`feedbackRouterHandler(int confidenceLevel)` will take in a confidence level 0, 1 or 2. 0 meaning worse, 2 meaning best.

* 0 move to back of queue, does not update internal score.
* 1 move to back of queue, updates internal score as a failure.
* 2 remove from queue, updates internal score as a success.

This will allow Schedule to gauge a user's familiarity with a card and schedule review times appropriately.

===== How Schedule approximate forgetting curve
This part will go into the specifics of what a score means and how it is calculated.
This class has some math and many variables, here is a short reference for their meaning if they are not self evident.

* `lowerBoundRememberRate` default = 0.85. The percent of information we want users to retain.
* `learningPhase` default = 3. The number of days we denote as a learning phase.
* `lastInterval` default = 1. The last interval given to schedule a review.
* `easingFactor` default = 1.3. How easy is it for the user to remember a fact,
the larger this number the easier it is.
* `historicalEasingFactor` the cumulative form of `easingFactor`

Here is a simple summary of what is happening internally.

latexmath:[newEasingFactor = historicalEasingFactor * \frac{\log{(lowerBoundRememberRate)}}{\log{(successRate)}}]

Initially when the user first creates a card, we give then a grace period with `learningPhase`. During this period we do not want to penalise the user for mistakes as this is a grace period for the user to pick up new cards. Penalising would be irritating and might demotivate learning.
Any feedback within this period will not update the `easingFactor`, feedback will only update after the learning phase.

The `newEasingFactor` is dependent on latexmath:[\log{(successRate)}].
Suppose we want the user to retain 85% of the information learnt.
We set the `lowerBoundRememberRate` to 0.85.
If `successRate` < `lowerBoundRememberRate` newEasingFactor will reduce and card will be scheduled more frequently.
If the interval is too long, users might forget cards. Thus lowering the `easingFactor` and `intervals` will reduce.

A predicate filter is used in conjunction with Schedule class to retrieve a list of cards due for review.

==== Answer
===== Logic
AnswerCommand and AnswerCommandParser has a similar logic implementation to most commands.

.Structure for the Logic component of Answer. Parsing `answer c/0`.
image::answerLogic.png[width="800"]

==== Date parser for `showdue` and `schedule`
We presume that users would often want to review lists of flashcards, thus these are very frequently typed.
It would be very irritating if users had to constantly key in showdue d/14 m/4 y/2018 when its obviously just today's date.
Thus we designed these commands to be more intelligence and less strict about its input parameters.

Whichever field `d/ m/ y/` are not present, it will be assumed to be today's day, month or year.
So doing `showdue` without any parameters will just return cards due by today.

[NOTE]
Initially any typos or errors made would just assume users would like to get cards due by today.
However some users find this flexibility to be a bug, now we strictly enforce that `showdue` must be empty to return today's cards.

[NOTE]
Although only `showdue` is talked about. This is actually a generic date parser. `schedule` command uses the same thing.

=== Polymorphic flashcards
==== Current Implementation
Allowing different types of cards is essential to Flashy. This enables the user to add and edit a normal, MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks flashcard so that the user can learn more efficiently, and use whichever that suits his learning style. +
New classes `McqCard` and `FillBlanks` were created to implement this enhancement, and they inherit the Card class, as shown in Figure 11.

==== Deisgn Considerations
==== Aspect: Implementation of polymorphic flashcards
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have a class each for MCQ and fill blanks type flashcards and let them inherit the `Card` class. +
MCQ flashcards have the constraint that the back of the card should be an integer between 1 and the number of options available. +
For fill blanks flashcards, the constraint is that the number of answers should be the same as the number of blanks.
** Pros: In terms of usability, having constraints allows users to input the right arguments for different cards.
** Cons: Additional classes have to be implemented.

* *Alternative 2:* Just use a single `Card` class for all cards, so no constaints are set.
** Pros: No additional classes have to be implemented. Let the user add flashcards with any arguments.
** Cons: No constraints for the flashcards.

=== Adding and editing of polymorphic flashcards
==== Current implementation
The `addc` command is used to add all types of flashcards.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of add command for MCQ and fill blanks type flashcards.
* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Use `addc` for the adding of MCQ and fill blanks type flashcards.
** Pros: There would be less commands to keep track of and combining the command reduces repeated codes since there are similarities between adding of normal and other type cards. +
One example of similarity is shown in the code snippet for `seedu.flashy.logic.commands.AddCardCommand: executeUndoableCommand()` below.
** Cons: The add card command has to be changed which can result in undesired consequences if mistakes were made. Care has to be taken when implementing the add card feature for MCQ and fill blanks flashcards as both have constraints which cannot be violated. +
Thus the constraints have to be checked before allowing the flashcard is added, as shown in the code snippet for `seedu.flashy.logic.commands.AddCardCommandParser: parse()` +
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
            requireNonNull(model);

            try {
                model.addCard(cardToAdd);
            }
            // ... Catch exception ...

            if (tagsToAdd.isPresent()) {
                Set<Tag> tags = tagsToAdd.get();
                try {
                    model.addTags(cardToAdd, tags);
                }
                // ... Catch exception ...
            }

            // ... Return result ...

        }
----

[source,java]
----
    public AddCardCommand parse(String args) {
        // ...

        try {
            // ... Parse arguments ...

            if (options.isEmpty()) {
                if (FillBlanksCard.containsBlanks(front)) {
                    card = ParserUtil.parseFillBlanksCard(front, back);
                } else {
                    card = new Card(front, back);
                }
            } else {
                for (String option: options) {
                    ParserUtil.parseMcqOption(option);
                }
                card = ParserUtil.parseMcqCard(front, back, options);
                card.setType(McqCard.TYPE);
            }

            return new AddCardCommand(card, tags);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
        }
    }
----

* **Alternative 2**: Implement a different `addm` and `addf` command for adding of MCQ and fill blanks type flashcard respectively. +
** Pros: No changes needs to be made to the `addc` command. Even if `addm` or `addf` fails, `addc` command can still work.
** Cons: Less commands for developers to keep track of. It is also less efficient to have similar codes for different commands. +
If there is a change in implementation, developers would have to change code for three separate commands, which is troublesome.
// end::polymorphiccards[]

// tag::storage[]
=== Storage of flashcards
==== Current Implementation
The current implementation saves the flashcard data in XML format and reads it back when the card bank is loaded.
A single `XmlAdaptedCard` class is used to convert the attributes of flashcards into XML Elements and `XmlSerializableCardBank` stores a list of `XmlAdaptedCard`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of `XmlAdaptedCard` class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a single `XmlAdaptedCard` class to convert all types of flashcards into XML format.
** Pros: Flashcards would be stored in the order in which they were added.
** Cons: `XmlAdaptedCard` has to be tweaked to take in the `options` attribute from the `McqCard` class, and the `toModelType()` method has to check for the constraints of the MCQ and fill blanks flashcard as shown in the code snippets below: +
From `src.main.java.seedu.flashy.storage.XmlAdaptedCard`
[source,java]
----
    public class XmlAdaptedCard {

        // ... Other attributes ...

        @XmlElement(required = true)
        private List<String> option = new ArrayList<>();

        // ... Constructors and methods ...
    }

    // ...

    public Card toModelType() throws IllegalValueException {
        // ... Check id, front, back constraints ...

        if (this.type.equals(FillBlanksCard.TYPE)) {
            if (!FillBlanksCard.isValidFillBlanksCard(this.front, this.back)) {
                // ... Catch exception ...
            }
            // ... Return card ...;
        }
        if (this.type.equals(McqCard.TYPE)) {
            if (!McqCard.isValidMcqCard(this.back, this.option)) {
                // ... Catch exception ...
            }
            // ... Return card ...
        }
        // ... Return card ...
     }
----

* **Alternative 2:** Implementing a separate `XmlAdaptedMcqCard` and `XmlAdaptedFillBlanksCard` to convert MCQ and fill blanks flashcards into XML format respectively. +
Initially, `XmlAdaptedMcqCard` was implemented to inherit `XmlAdaptedCard`. In `XmlSerializableCardBank`, there would be a separate list for `XmlAdaptedMcqCard`, as shown in the code snippet below (which was implemented initially but later removed from source code):
[source,java]
----
    public class XmlSerializableCardBank {
        // ... Other attributes ...

        @XmlElement
        private List<XmlAdaptedCard> cards;

        // New list for XmlAdaptedMcqCards
        @XmlElement
        private List<XmlAdaptedMcqCard> mcqCards;

        /**
         * Conversion
         */
        public XmlSerializableCardBank(ReadOnlyCardBank src) {
            // ...
            for (Card card: src.getCardList()) {
                if (card.getType().equals(McqCard.TYPE)) {
                    mcqCards.add(new XmlAdaptedMcqCard(...));
                } else {
                    cards.add(new XmlAdaptedCard(...));
                }
            }
        }
        // ...
    }
----
** Pros: No need to tweak `XmlAdaptedCard` and both classes would be separate, so mistakes in `XmlAdaptedMcqCard` would not affect that in `XmlAdaptedCard`. There's no need to check for `McqCard` constraints.
** Cons: `XmlAdaptedCard` and `XmlAdaptedMcqCard` would be stored in separate lists in XML format. When the card bank is loaded, both lists would be read separately and the order in which the cards were added would not be captured.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.flashy.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.flashy.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.flashy.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.flashy.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashy/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Flashy depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
