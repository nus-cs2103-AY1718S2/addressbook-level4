== Introduction

PrioriTask is a desktop task management application. It is not just any task management application, but a combination of the to-do list, calendar and reminder features, with an added bonus of an automatic updating and sorting of your tasks based on priority levels. It helps you keep track of your tasks, while providing you with at-a-glance views of upcoming tasks by day, week or month.

PrioriTask is a fairly new application that has much room for improvement. We welcome any form of contributions to the PrioriTask project, be it from beginners or seasoned Java developers. Whether you're a new developer or an experienced contributor, this guide can serve as a helpful reference and source for information about writing code for the PrioriTask project.

This developer's guide consists of the following sections.

* <<Getting Started>>
* <<Design>>
* <<Implementation>>
* <<Documentation>>
* <<Testing>>
* <<Dev Ops>>

== Getting Started

This section contains information to help you get started developing for PrioriTask. The simple list below will ensure that you get up and running with the application in no time.

* <<Installing prerequisites>>
* <<Setting up the project in your computer>>
* <<Verifying the setup>>
* <<Configuring the project before writing code>>
* <<Getting started with developing>>

=== Installing prerequisites

Before working on PrioriTask, ensure that you have the following software installed.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
PrioriTask works best on JDK `1.8.0_60` or later. +
It will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
PrioriTask requires Gradle and JavaFX plugins. +
IntelliJ has both plugins installed by default. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

After you've ensured that you've met all requirements, follow the steps below to setup this project in your computer.

[NOTE]
The following steps are written for IntelliJ IDEA `2017.3.5` (Ultimate Edition). +
There may be slight variations in the steps if using other versions of IntelliJ.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ. You should see the welcome screen (refer to <<fig-GettingStarted1>>).
.. If you do not see the welcome screen, select `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.

[start=8]
. Click on the JDK `1.8` folder in the left pane and click `Next`.
.. If you do not see a JDK `1.8` folder, click on `+` > `JDK`, and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Next` until you reach the last window. Click `Finish` to complete the import of the project. The project will be loaded and you will be brought to the main project window (refer to <<fig-GettingStarted5>>).

[[fig-GettingStarted5]]
.Main Project Window
image::DeveloperGettingStarted5.png[width="600"]

[start=10]
. Select `File` > `New` > `Module from Existing Sources...`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`. You will be directed to the `Import Module from Gradle` window (refer to <<fig-GettingStarted6>>).

[[fig-GettingStarted6]]
.`Import Module from Gradle` Window
image::DeveloperGettingStarted6.png[width="600"]

. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open the `Terminal` (select `Tool Windows` > `Terminal`) and run the command `gradlew processResources` (run `./gradlew processResources` for Mac/Linux users). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

After setting up the project, do the following steps to verify that the project has been correctly set up.

. Run the `seedu.organizer.MainApp` and try a few commands. You may refer to the <<UserGuide#, UserGuide.adoc>> for more information about the commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configuring the project before writing code

Before you begin developing, there are a few configurations to be done to ensure that the code you write meets our project standards.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (Mac).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write the code.

==== Setting up CI

This project relies heavily on Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI). You may also set up Travis for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version, but is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures the application works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

=== Getting started with developing

When you are ready to start developing,

1. Read <<Design-Architecture>> to get some sense of the overall design.
2. Look at <<Implementation>> to find out more about the major features, and better understand how you can contribute enhancements to those features.

== Design

PrioriTask consists of multiple components written in Java, with data being written and stored in XML files. This section contains an overview of the architecture systems used to design and implement the application, and an introduction to some of its major components.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the application.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

Given below is a quick overview of each component. The two main components of the application includes:

. `Main`, with only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

.. Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other at application launch.
.. Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary during shut down.

. <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>, representing a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

.. `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
.. `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

The rest of the application consists of four components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Represents the UI of the application
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

Each of the four components,

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to <<fig-LogicComponent>>) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[[fig-LogicComponent]]

[infoblock-title]#*More Information*#

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteTask.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `OrganizerChangedEvent` when the Organizer data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.
====

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of numerous parts (e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarPanel`, etc.). All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The class diagram below describes the structure of the `UI` component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component consists of the commands and their respective parsers (if necessary). For commands requiring parsers, they are defined in `.java` files prefixed with _'-Parser'_ that are in the `src/main/java/logic/parser` folder. For example, the parser for `AddCommand` is specified in `AddCommandParser.java`.

The class diagram below gives an overview of the structure of the `Logic` component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

There are two types of commands. Commands that modify the state of the organizer inherit from the `UndoableCommand` class, to be used by the undo/redo mechanism (see <<Undo/Redo feature>> for more information). Commands that do not modify the state of the organizer, and cannot be undone, inherit from the `Command` class instead.

The class diagram below gives a more detailed overview of how the command system in the `Logic` component works. It shows the finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>.

[[fig-CommandsDiagram]]
.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[fig-LogicSequenceDiagram]]
.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

The sequence flow is as follows:

.  `Logic` uses the `OrganizerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component consists of a `UniqueTaskList` and `UniqueTagList` that contains and manipulates the data within the application using an `ObservableList`. The component also includes `Task`, and its respective parameters (e.g. `Name`, `Priority`, `Date Added`, etc.).

The class diagram below gives an overview of the structure of the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Organizer data.
* updates Tasks' priority levels within the Organizer via the `UniqueTaskList` automatically.
* sorts tasks within the Organizer.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' (e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component consists of the `XmlOrganizerStorage`, which reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. Data is stored in XML format, and can be retrieved from `data` > `organizer.xml`. The component also contains the `UserPrefsStorage`, which stores user preferences (e.g. the application window's preferred height and width) in a JSON file. The file is titled `preferences.json`, and can be retrieved from the main folder.

The class diagram below gives an overview of the structure of the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* saves `UserPref` objects in JSON format and reads it back.
* saves the Organizer data in XML format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.organizer.commons` package. Such classes include the `EventsCenter` and `LogsCenter`.

== Implementation

PrioriTask consists of many different features. This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Undo/Redo feature

The `undo` feature restores the PrioriTask to the state before the previous undoable command was executed. Undoable commands are defined as commands that modify the PrioriTask’s content (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).

The `redo` feature does the opposite - it reverses the most recent `undo` command.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the organizer (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

`UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the organizer before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while child classes implement the details of how to execute the class-specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

==== Scenario

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th task in the organizer. The current state of the organizer is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

The diagram below illustrates how the execution of the `delete 5` command affects the `UndoRedoStack`.

.UndoRedoStack `delete 5` command execution
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/Study ...` to add a new task.

The diagram below illustrates how the execution of the `add n/Study` command affects the `UndoRedoStack`.

.UndoRedoStack `add n/Study ...` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the organizer to the state before the `add` command executed.

The diagram below illustrates the process of the execution of the `undo` command on the `UndoRedoStack`.

.UndoRedoStack `undo` command execution
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.UndeRedoStack sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the organizer to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/Study` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

The diagram below illustrates how the execution of the `clear` command affects the `UndoRedoStack`.

.UndoRedoStack `clear` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution (refer to <<fig-ListExecution>>).

[[fig-ListExecution]]
.UndoRedoStack `list` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.UndoRedoStack activity diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: Any undone/redone functionality is not lost as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire organizer
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: Need to ensure that the implementation of the counter to each command is correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the organizer (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: Only reverts changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the organizer and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For each new command executed, both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack` must be updated.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: Must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

// tag::taskpriority[]
=== Task's Priority Auto-updating and Auto-sorting feature

_{ TODO: Add preface }_

==== Current Implementation

The autoupdating and autosorting mechanism resides inside `UniqueTaskList`. The `UniqueTaskList` is responsible for updating each Task’s priority level and sorting the `ObservableList<Task>` whenever a new `Task` is added. In addition, whenever a `Task` is edited, the `ObservableList<Task>` is sorted again.

===== Description of `UniqueTaskList` 's `add` method

The `add` method of the `UniqueTaskList` class is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
public void add(Task toAdd) throws DuplicateTaskException {
    //check non null and no duplicate task
    toAdd = updatePriority(toAdd);
    internalList.add(toAdd);
    sortTasks();
}
----

===== Priority Auto-updating feature

The `updatePriority` method returns a new `Task` with a new `Priority` based on the current date, `AddedDate`, and `Deadline`.

The new `Priority` level will remain within the range of 0 - 9. The new `Priority` is calculated as such :

* If the current date is equal to the `AddedDate`
** `Priority` remains the same.
* If the current date is past the `Deadline`
** `Priority` is set to the `HIGHEST_SETTABLE_PRIORITY_LEVEL` : 9
* If the current date is before the `Deadline` and not equal to the `AddedDate`
** `Priority` is calculated via the following formula :

[source,java]
----
priorityDifferenceFromMax = HIGHEST_SETTABLE_PRIORITY_LEVEL - currentPriority

dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline = Duration.between(currentDate, deadline)

dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline = Duration.between(dateAdded, deadline)

priorityToIncrease = priorityDifferenceFromMax * ((dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline - dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline) / dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline)

newPriority = currentPriority + priorityToIncrease
----

The new `Task` with its updated `Priority` will then be added to `UniqueTaskList`’s `internalList`. Following that, the `internalList` is sorted via the `sortTasks` method. The `sortTasks` method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void sortTasks() {
    internalList.sort(Task.priorityComparator());
}
----

===== Task Auto-sorting feature

The `sortTasks` method makes use of the `ObservableList` class’s `sort` method and `Task`’s `priorityComparator` method. The `priorityComparator` method returns a `Comparator` that sorts `Task` s based on descending `Priority` levels. The `internalList` is sorted with respect to the comparator.

==== Scenario

Consider an `addTask` method call by the `Organizer`. The current date is 2018-03-19.

The following is a sequence diagram which represents the `Organizer` adding a Study `Task`.

.addTask(Study) method execution sequence diagram
image::OrganizerAddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose the `tasks` currently contains the following two `Task` s.

.`tasks` 's initial `Task` s
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram1.png[width="600"]

The following figure represents the "Study" `Task`.

."Study" `Task`
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram2.png[width="200"]

When `tasks` calls `updatePriority(Study)`, the new priority level is calculated as such :

[source,java]
----
priorityDifferenceFromMax = 9 - 0 = 9

dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline = 14

dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline = 31

priorityToIncrease = 9 * ((31 - 14) / 31) = 4

newPriority = 0 + 4 = 4
----

A new "Study" `Task` is created and added to the `internalList`.

.`internalList` after "Study" `Task` is added
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram3.png[width="600"]

The `sortTasks` method is then called, which calls the `priorityCompartor` method, and uses the `Comparator` returned to sort the `Task` s. This results in the following `UniqueTaskList`.

.`internalList` after `sortTasks` is called
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram4.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect : Implementation of `updatePriority`

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Add a new method `updatePriority` in UniqueTaskList’s `add`
** Pros : Convenient to update the priority during this method call; since during initialization of `Organizer`, `add` is called for every `Task` to initialize the `UniqueTaskList`.
** Cons : Possible violation of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `UniqueTaskList` now updates `Task` priorities and stores `Task` s.
* Alternative 2 : Add a new class `UpdatedUniqueTaskList` which extends `UniqueTaskList`
** Pros : Removes violation of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns in Alternative 1.
** Cons : Repeats the logic in `UniqueTaskList` while adding one method.

===== Aspect : How `updatePriority` executes

* Alternative 1 (current choice) : Return a new `Task` with new `Priority`
** Pros : Easy to implement.
** Cons : A new object is created twice during every addition, even if `Priority` is not updated; Hence slightly inefficient.
* Alternative 2 : Edit the `Priority` parameter of the `Task`
** Pros : No new objects are created.
** Cons : Requires major overhaul of `Task` and it’s parameters to be mutable.

===== Aspect : Scope of `updatePriority` and `sortTasks`

* Alternative 1 (current choice) : Implement within `Model`
** Pros : No need to deal with commands, and fits with the idea of automation.
** Cons : Concern of updating priorities and sorting tasks may not lie with `Model` but `Logic`.
* Alternative 2 : Implement within `Logic`
** Pros : Fits with the concern of updating priorities and sorting tasks.
** Cons : Requires development of commands and extra command calls to be automatically called upon start of application; unnecessary trouble for same feature.

// end::taskpriority[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature

The `Calendar` resides mainly in the `UI` component, constantly interacting with the `Logic` and `Model` components to complete its tasks. It allows users to have a chronic overview of the deadlines of all their tasks. Tasks on the calendar changes according to the last task listing. By default, users will view the current month when they first open PrioriTask.

The calendar feature is currently still in its early stages of implementation. At present, it only supports the switching between months, and is best viewed fully-maximised on a 13” computer screen.

==== Current Implementation

The calendar feature is facilitated by the `MonthView` class, which supports the `CalendarPanel`. The `MonthView` is responsible for displaying a monthly calendar view to the users through the `CalendarPanel`. The following diagram illustrates the structure of the calendar feature system:

.Structure of the Calendar Feature
image::CalendarComponentClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the different classes work together to display the calendar when users first run the application.

.Calendar Sequence Diagram
image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

Below describes the the implementation of the different classes supporting the calendar feature.

===== Implementation of `EntryCard`
`EntryCard` is responsible for displaying the name of a `Task` on the calendar. It is called by `MonthView` when mapping each `Task` to an `EntryCard`. The method is implemented as such:
[source,java]
----
private ObservableList<EntryCard> getEntryCardsList(int year, int month) {
    FilteredList<Task> filteredList = getFilteredTaskList(year, month);
    SortedList<Task> taskSortedList = getSortedTaskList(filteredList);

    return EasyBind.map(taskSortedList, (task) -> new EntryCard(task));
}
----

An `EntryCard` will be added to a specific date which reflects the deadline of the `Task`. It is displayed on the calendar with the help of the JavaFX `ListView` object. More details of how this is implemented is further discussed in <<Implementation of `MonthView`>>.

===== Implementation of `MonthView`

`MonthView` is in charge of executing several tasks. It is responsible for,

* Drawing the month view of the calendar, and populating the dates.

* Adding the tasks’ entries onto the calendar, according to the last task listing. The calendar is also updated every time an undoable command is executed (refer to <<Undo/Redo feature>> for more details about an undoable command).
* Aiding the `Logic` component by switching the month view accordingly when users execute the respective calendar feature commands (e.g. `pmonth`, `nmonth`, etc.). A calendar feature command is defined as a command that changes the display of the calendar. For the full list of calendar feature commands, head to <<UserGuide#calendar-features, User Guide: Calendar Features>>.

`MonthView` interacts very closely with its corresponding FXML file, `MonthView.fxml` to execute its tasks. The FXML file reflects the basic layout of the calendar feature, which is illustrated by the diagram below.

.Basic Calendar Layout
image::MonthViewLayoutDiagram.png[width="700"]

MonthView` uses the JavaFX layout objects extensively when executing its tasks. The following are some instances when JavaFX layout objects are called:

* Populating the dates in the calendar: Adding a `Text` object, which contains the numerical value of a particular date, to the exact column and row in the `taskCalendar`. The method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void addMonthDate(Text dateToPrint, int column, int row) {
    // To update the JavaFX component from a non-JavaFX thread
    Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            taskCalendar.add(dateToPrint, column, row);
        }
    });

    taskCalendar.setHalignment(dateToPrint, HPos.LEFT);
    taskCalendar.setValignment(dateToPrint, VPos.TOP)
    dateToPrint.setId("date" + String.valueOf(dateCount));
}
----

* Adding the tasks’ entries onto the calendar: Adding a `ListView` object, which contains a list of `EntryCard`s, to the exact column and row in the `taskCalendar`. An `EntryCard` represents a task entry, which will be added to the date which reflects the deadline of the task. The method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void addEntryListView(ObservableList<EntryCard> toAddObservableList, int row, int column) {
    ListView<EntryCard> entries = new ListView<>();
    entries.setId("entry" + String.valueOf(row) + String.valueOf(column));
    entries.setItems(toAddObservableList);
    entries.setCellFactory(listView -> new EntryListViewCell());
    entries.setMaxHeight(60);

    // To update the JavaFX component from a non-JavaFX thread
    Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            taskCalendar.add(entries, column, row);
        }
    });

    taskCalendar.setValignment(entries, VPos.BOTTOM);
}
----

`MonthView` also works very closely with the `Logic` component to accomplish,

* Adding of the tasks’ entries onto the calendar, by retrieving an unmodifiable `ObservableList` containing the list of `Task`s. A listener to added to the `ObservableList` so that the calendar is updated with the latest tasks’ entries when a change in the list is detected. The method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void addListenerToTaskList() {
    taskList.addListener(new ListChangeListener<Task>() {
        @Override
        public void onChanged(Change change) {
            while (change.next()) {
                clearCalendar();
                setMonthCalendarDatesAndEntries(viewYearMonth.getYear(), viewYearMonth.getMonthValue());
            }
        }
    });
}
----

* Switching the month view when users execute the respective calendar feature commands, by retrieving an `ObservableList` containing a list of executed commands by the user. A listener is added to the `ObservableList` so that the month view is changed accordingly when a calendar feature command in the list is detected. The method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void addListenerToExecutedCommandsList() {
    executedCommandsList.addListener(new ListChangeListener<String>() {
        @Override
        public void onChanged(Change change) {
            while (change.next()) {
                int size = executedCommandsList.size();
                String executedCommand = executedCommandsList.get(size - 1);

                if ((executedCommand.equals(CurrentMonthCommand.COMMAND_WORD)) || (executedCommand.equals(CurrentMonthCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS))) {
                    goToCurrentMonth();
                }

                // … other similiar if statements for the remaining calendar feature commands ...
            }
        }
    });
}
----

===== Implementation of `CalendarPanel`
`CalendarPanel` simply displays the calendar, by using the JavaFX `StackPane` object as a placeholder for `MonthView`, which contains the basic layout of the calendar. After loading its own FXML file, it will fetch the display for `MonthView` as such:


[source,java]
----
private void createMainView() {
    monthView.getMonthView(currentYearMonth);
    calendarPane.getChildren().add(monthView.getRoot());
}
----

==== Scenario

Suppose the user executes a calendar feature command. Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` and `UI` components for the execute(“nmonth”) API call.

.Calendar Sequence Diagram
image::CalendarCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The sequence flow is slightly similar to that of the execution of a normal command (refer to <<fig-LogicSequenceDiagram>>), and is as follows:

. `Logic` uses the `OrganizerParser` class to parse the calendar feature command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution triggers the `MonthView` class in the `UI`, which will display the new month view.
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed to the `UI`. It will be shown in the `Result Display Box`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of calendar feature
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Draw the calendar manually using the JavaFX library
** Pros: Feature is customised for the PrioriTask application.
** Cons: Too much time invested in creating a feature that has been already been developed and freely available.
* *Alternative 2:* Use a third-party framework / library
** Pros: Speed up development, especially if it has already been thoroughly tested and does not have many bugs.
** Cons: Not customised for the application, and may require much time to tweak or work around the framework / library to suit the application.

===== Aspect: Updating of tasks’ entries on the calendar
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Clears the calendar, and draws everything (i.e. the dates and entries) again
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues. There may be a lag after an undoable is executed.
* *Alternative 2:* Track the `Task` that is being added / modified, and update the calendar accordingly
** Pros: Update of the calendar will be almost instantaneous. Chances of a lag is rare.
** Cons: Difficult to implement. Need to ensure that the tracking of `Task`s added / modified is accurate.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::subtask[]
=== Subtask

_{ TODO: Add preface }_

==== Current Implementation

Subtask feature allows user to split their tasks into multiple subtasks. This feature allows user to better
manage their task. It is implemented using `Subtask` class and `UniqueSubtaskList` class as shown by the diagram below:

.Subtask UML Class Diagram
image::SubtaskComponentDiagram.png[width="500"]

`UniqueSubtaskList` is created to ensure that no task has a duplicated subtask.

*Subtask management*

To manage the subtasks (Add, edit, etc), a copy of the `Task` object is created, since `Task` is immutable.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Implementation of `Subtask`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Add a new class `Subtask`
** Pros: Better isolation and easier modification to `Subtask` if needed.
** Cons: Restricts the possibility of having a subtask that has subtasks.

* **Alternative 2:** Use current `Task` class
** Pros: Easier to implement and subtask will share the same properties with `Task`.
** Cons: Possibility of having a cyclic subtask (a task that is also a subtask of it self) if not handled carefully.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UniqueSubtaskList`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Use `List` to store subtasks.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Performance issues when data is large, since most operations in `UniqueSubtaskList`
is `O(n)`.

* **Alternative 2 (Planned for implementation):** Use a combination of BBST and LinkedList to store subtasks.
** Pros: Faster than the first alternative since each operation is `O(log n)`.
** Cons: Harder to implement and more robust testing is required since it is more bug prone.

// end::subtask[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through the `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : A message level indicating a _serious_ failure (e.g. failure resulting in application termination).
* `WARNING` : A message level indicating a _potential_ problem (e.g. application can still continue, but do so with caution).
* `INFO` : A message level for _informational_ messages (e.g. noteworthy actions by the application).
* `FINE` : A message level providing _tracing_ information (e.g. print the actual list of an array instead of its size).

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application (e.g App name, logging level) can be controlled through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

Asciidoc is used for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
Asciidoc was chosen over Markdown as asciidoc provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of edits.

Alternatively, the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ provides a real-time view of `.adoc` file edits .

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] can be used for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

The following are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Access the generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For the best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the third method. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library, GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. This means that the developer is free to do something else while the tests are running.

To run the tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

There are two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - Tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that tests the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are found in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test individual components. These are found in `seedu.organizer.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - Tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that check the integration of multiple code units (these code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of _unit_ and _integration_ tests. These tests check multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: `UserGuide.html`, a dependency which should be found in `src/main/resources/docs`, is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] are used to perform _Continuous Integration_ on the project. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] is used to track the code coverage of the project. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request contains changes to asciidoc files, https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] can be used to preview a HTML version of the edited asciidoc files. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

The following are steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`.
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, PrioriTask depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives: +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
