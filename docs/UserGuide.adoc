== Introduction
Delivery is targeted at restaurants, especially for the small-medium ones, which want to have a system to keep track customers’ orders and delivery.

A restaurant can have hundreds of orders a day and it’s extremely troublesome for the restaurant stuff to manually write down all customer information (including their names, contact numbers, addresses, orders and expected time of delivery etc.) and keep track on it.

Hence, they need a software to store all the information mentioned above in an organised manner.

Delivery is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing orders*. More importantly, Delivery is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Delivery can manage the orders faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `delivery.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the database of customers' personal particulars.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all orders
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 f/Chicken Rice` : adds an order of chicken rice from customer `John Doe` to the queue.
* **`process`**`3` : process the 3rd order shown in the current list and add it to the processing queue
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Each command has an alias as the shortcut for advanced users to execute commands faster. +
   (e.g. for the "add" command, you can either type "add" or "a")
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [h/HALAL]` can be used as `n/John Doe h/Halal` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help: `help`

Format: `path INDEX` or `p INDEX`

****
* See setOwnAddress command would be avaiable in v2.0, now default own address is 'NUS'.
****
****
* Shows path to the order’s address which is identified by the index number used in the current show order book list,
using Google Map.
* The index refers to the index number of the order.

Add an tag to an existing order in the order book.

Format: `edit INDEX tagWord`

[TIP]
Adds 'Delivering', 'Delivered' and see its position in the order book. Use
edit command to clear tags.

****
* Order book is the left dispalyed panel.
****
****
* Only 'Delivering', 'Delivered' would be recognized for ordering. ('delivering''delivered' would not affect
an order's position)
****
****
* Edits the order at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the current shown list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ..
* Existing order will be updated with input tagWord.
* Different from edit command, adding of tags is cumulative.
****
****
* Label orders with tag 'Delivering','Delivering' would change their position in the order book.
* Once a order is processed, it will go below unprocessed orders, so that there is no need for user to scroll all
the way down to process newly-added unprocessed order.
* *Do not tag an order as 'Processed' as process commands would do the job.*
* Once an order has been cooked, the order would be labelled as 'Cooked', and it will go to the top of the order book
to remind user to send out delivery man.
* *Do not tag an order as 'Cooked' as complete commands would do the job.*
* When an order is tagged as 'Delivering', it would go above all the cooked orders.
* Finally, when an order is tagged as 'Delivered', it would go all the way to the bottom as the order
 is consider closed.
****
Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* We have five orders being processed.

image::UG_Tag_1.png[width="790"]

* Enter completeMore order command to complete first three orders, 'Curry Chicken' 'Ban Mian' and 'Chicken Chop'

>> `cM 3`

* Now these three orders are labelled as 'Cooked'

image::UG_Tag_2.png[width="790"]

* We send out delivery man for Chicken Chop and tag it as 'Delivering'

>> `tag 3 Delivering` Notice no t/ needed

image::UG_Tag_4.png[width="790"]

* We can see it jumps to the top of the order book.

* Finally when it is delivered, we enter

>> `tag 1 Delivered` to push it to the bottom

image::UG_Tag_3.png[width="790"]

// end::AddTag[]

// tag::Load[]
=== Load a web page: `load url` (Since v1.5)

You can try to load a web page in the browser panel, which is the middle window in the main window.

Format: `load url` or `ld url`

****
* Url is the web page link, for instance: https://www.google.com.sg, https://www.youtube.com
* Note that user needs to enter 'https://' before the normal web link entered in web browser.
****
****
* Unlike normal web browser, there is no go back previous page function and no open in new tab function.
****
****
* This is only an small extra function. As a result, *the function would not be guaranteed to work and
 the behaviour of the function may vary from user to user*.
****
Example

Example scenario 1:

* You want to load google search page to find out something.

image::UG_Load_1.png[width="790"]

* Enter

>> `load https://www.google.com.sg` or `ld https://www.google.com.sg`

* Then you can see

image::UG_Load_2.png[width="790"]
// end::Load[]

// tag::ProcessingQueue[]
=== Process an order (add to the processing queue): `process` (Since v1.5)

You can now process an existing order from the order book to the processing queue, indicating that the order now in being cooked.

Format: `process INDEX` or `ps INDEX`

****
* You can use `ps INDEX` for faster input.
****
****
* Processing queue is the right dispalyed panel.
****
****
* Processing queue has a max capacity(default size is 5), to represents the ability of the restaurants to preparing
orders(ie number of chefs, number of cookers, etc). Therefore, once the processing queue is full, no more order can be
processed until some orders are cooked.
****

Things to take note

* Index must be valid, meaning it can only be a positive integer that is no bigger than the total orders in the order book now.
* One order in the order book cannot be processed twice.
* Once a valid command is entered, the selected order would be added to the processing queue and the original order in the order book will be labelled as processed.
* If user manually remove 'Processed' tag from an order with tag 'Cooked' or 'Delivering' or 'Delivered', then further
process commands would not add the order to the processing queue again.
* Processed orders in the order book(left panel) would sink below than unprocessed orders. If you think order disappears in the order book after type
process command, try to scroll down below unprocessed orders to see it.

****
* Display of an order in the order queue is simplified, showing only food, address and inception time.
* The processing queue is a normal queue without any ordering.
****

[TIP]
User could user lazier version `processNext` command, to avoiding trouble of entering INDEX

Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* There is only one order in the order book. To process the first order, we enter

>> `process` or `ps`

* we get feedback message saying that the index is required.

image::UG_Process_1.png[width="790"]

* After that, we enter correct command

>> `process 1` or `ps 1`

* We can see the result below. The order is added to the processing queue and the original order
 is labelled "Processed".

image::UG_Process_2.png[width="790"]

Example scenario 2:

* After scenario 1, we add more orders to the order book. Now there are several order in the order book. Notice that the
order Chicken Chop, which is processed in scenario 1, now is ranked below all unprocessed orders.

image::UG_Process_3.png[width="790"]

* Now we enter command

>> `process 2` or `ps 2`

* We can see the result below. The order "Ice Milo" is added to the processing queue and the original order
 is labelled "Processed". Now Ice Milo also goes below unprocessed orders.

image::UG_Process_4.png[width="790"]

// end::ProcessingQueue[]
=== Process the next unprocessed order(add to the processing queue): `processNext` (Since v1.5)

To save time, you can process an existing unprocessed order from the order book to the processing queue, without
worrying about the index. ProcessNext would automatically find the first unprocessed order in the current shown list.

Format: `processNext` or `pN`

****
* You can use `pN` for faster input. Note the capital 'N'.
****
****
* Processing queue is the right dispalyed panel.
****
****
* Processing queue has a max capacity(default size is 5), to represents the ability of the restaurants to preparing
orders(ie number of chefs, number of cookers, etc). Therefore, once the processing queue is full, no more order can be
processed until some orders are cooked.
****
Things to take note

* If all orders in the shown list have been processed, message "All Order have been processed".
* One order in the order book cannot be processed twice.
* If user manually remove 'Processed' tag from an order with tag 'Cooked' or 'Delivering' or 'Delivered', then further
process commands would not add the order to the processing queue again.
* Processed orders in the order book(left panel) would sink below than unprocessed orders. If you think order disappears in the order book after type
process command, try to scroll down below unprocessed orders to see it.

[TIP]
User could user even lazier version `processMore NUMBER` command, to avoiding trouble of entering
`processNext` multiple time

Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* Now our orders are these.

image::UG_Process_4.png[width="790"]

* To process the next order, which is 'Curry Chicken' in this case, we simply enter

>> `processNext` or `pN`

* We can see the result below. The 'Curry Chicken' order is added to the processing queue and the original order
 is labelled "Processed".

image::UG_Process_5.png[width="790"]

Example scenario 2:

* After scenario 1, we realize Ice Milo is finished preparing. We use  Notice it goes all the way to the top of the list, as a
remainder for you to send out the delivery man.

****
* For details of order's ranking in order book, please refer to tag command section)
****

image::UG_Process_6.png[width="790"]

* Now the next order to be processed is Ban Mian, which is at position 2. We enter

>> `processNext` or `pN`

* We can see the result below. The order "Ban Mian" is added to the processing queue and the original order
 is labelled as "Processed".
* ProcessNext skips the first processed order.

image::UG_Process_7.png[width="790"]

=== Process the next n unprocessed orders(add to processing queue): `processMore`(Since v1.5)

Now you can process the next n unprocessed order at one simpler command.

Format: `processMore NUMBER` or `pM NUMBER`

****
* You can use `pM` for faster input. Note the capital 'M'.
****
****
* Processing queue is the right dispalyed panel.
****
****
* Processing queue has a max capacity(default size is 5), to represents the ability of the restaurants to preparing
orders(ie number of chefs, number of cookers, etc). Therefore, once the processing queue is full, no more order can be
processed until some orders are cooked.
****
Things to take note

* Number must be a positive integer
* There is no upper bound to the number, as once the all the orders are processed or the processing queue is full,
the adding and labelling would stop. However, we advise user *not to enter absurdly large number to avoid unusual
 behavior*.

Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* Now our orders are these. There are five orders waiting to be processed.

image::UG_Process_8.png[width="790"]

* To process all five orders, we simply enter

>> `processMore 5` or `pM 5`

* We can see the result below. All five orders are added to the processing queue and the original orders
 are labelled "Processed".

image::UG_Process_9.png[width="790"]

=== Complete an order (delete form processing queue): `completeOne` (Since v1.5)

After processing an order and the food is now ready to be delivered, you can use complete order command to remove the
order from the processing queue, and label the original order in the order book as 'Cooked'.

Format: `completeOne INDEX` or `cOne INDEX`

****
* You can use `cOne INDEX` for faster input. Note the capital 'O'.
****
****
* Processing queue is the right dispalyed panel.
****

Things to take note

****
* Completes and removes the order in the processing queue at the specified `INDEX`.
* The original order in the order book would be labelled as 'Cooked' and jumps to the top of the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as the default full capacity of the processing queue is 5.
****

Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* Now our orders are these. There are three orders be processing. Suppose food 'Curry Chicken' has finished cooking.
Notice it is currently second in the processing queue.

image::UG_Complete_1.png[width="790"]

* To complete it, we simply enter

>> `completeOne 2` or `cOne 2`

* We can see the result below. 'Curry Chicken' is deleted from the processing queue and the original order
 is labelled "Cooked". Notice the 'Cooked' 'Curry Chicken' would go above unprocessed and processing orders to remind
 the user to send out delivery man.

image::UG_Complete_2.png[width="790"]

=== Complete n orders (delete form processing queue): `completeMore`

Similar to completeOne command, now multiple orders can be finished and removed from the processing
queue at the same time. Completes first n orders from the order queue, n is the NUMBER inputted. +

Format: `completeOrder NUMBER` or `cMore NUMBER`

****
* You can use `cM NUMBER` for faster input. Note the capital 'M'.
****
****
* Order queue is the right dispalyed panel.
****
****
* Completes first n orders.
* The number cannot be more than the total orders in order queue.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as the default full capacity of the processing queue is 5.
****

Examples:

Example scenario 1:

* From previous example, there are still two orders be processing. Suppose food 'Chicken Chop' and
 'Ban Mian' have finished cooking at the same time. We would now wants to complete both using one command.

image::UG_Complete_2.png[width="790"]

* To do so, we simply enter

>> `completeMore 2` or `cM 2`

* We can see the result below. Both 'Chicken Chop' and 'Ban Mian' are deleted from the processing queue and
the original orders are labelled "Cooked". Notice the 'Cooked' 'Chicken Chop' and 'Ban Mian' would go above
unprocessed and processing orders to remind the user to send out delivery man.

image::UG_Complete_3.png[width="790"]

Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the queue of orders (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +

There is no need to save manually.


// tag::count[]
=== Count the number of orders a customer has placed in the past

The statistics of customers will be stored in the hard disk as an XML file.
When a customer places an order, it accumulates (add 1) to the number of his/her past orders.

Examples:

* Initially no order has been placed so the output XML file is empty.

* `add n/Wu Hao p/91111111 f/Chicken Rice a/NUS` +
The customer with phone number "91111111" has accumulated 1 order. +
The result will be updated and stored in the XML file.

image::user1.png[width="800"]

* `add n/Zequn p/92222222 f/Chicken Rice a/NUS` +
Another customer with a different phone number "92222222" has accumulated 1 order. +
