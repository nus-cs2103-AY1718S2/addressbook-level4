== PROJECT: VetterAppointments

---

== Overview

VetterAppointments is a desktop application made for vets to manage appointments, clients, pets and staff. The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX and works via a command line interface (CLI) where users can enter single line commands to interact with the application. +

This project is part of a NUS CS2103T module. VetterAppointments was created by building upon an existing code base of the AddressBook-Level 4 project by https://github.com/se-edu/[SE-EDU] initiative. The application is written in Java and has about 20kLOC.

This portfolio showcases of some notable contributions that I have made for the CS2103T project. It can be used for the evaluation of my coursework and learning progress from the CS2103T module.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *autocomplete* functionality +
** What it does: provides the user with suggestions for completing their commands and allows the user to autocomplete their command by pressing tab.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because some commands of the application are long. A user can quickly enter the command they wish to type by using this autocomplete feature.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an additional component to the existing code base, little modification of the existing code base was required. However, the modification of the UI logic was required to handle the tab key press.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the support for *adding and removing clients and vet technicians* in the application +
** List of new/modified command enhancements:
*** AddCommand
*** DeleteCommand
*** EditCommand
*** AddVetTechToAppointentCommand
*** RemoveVetTechFromAppointmentCommand
