== Introduction

* STUtor is a *desktop app* tailored for *tuition coordinators* to easily _match_ and _manage_ a database of tutors and students.
* This app is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, STUtor can get your *tutor and student management tasks done efficiently*.

* This guide gives you an overview of the _basic_ and _advanced_ features of STUtor.

== Getting Started
This section helps you set up your STUtor app on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version __1.8.0_60__ or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest _STUtor.jar_ link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use for storing your STUtor.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You will see the interface in a few seconds.
+

// tag::ui[]

image::Ui_withLabels.png[width="500"]

*  Sections of STUtor:
** Section 1: *Command Box* to type your commands
** Section 2: *Result Display* to show the results of your command
** Section 3: *Pair List* to list all pairs currently matched
** Section 4: *Person List* to list all persons in the entire database
** Section 5: *Information Panel* to show all details of a person
// end::ui[]

*  Type the command in the Command Box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `*help*` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
*  Some example commands you can try:
** To list all contacts: `*list*`
** To add a contact named `John Doe` and his particulars to STUtor: `*add* n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 $/50 sub/Math lvl/Lower Sec r/Student`
** To delete the 3rd contact shown in the current list: `*delete* 3`
** To exit the app: `*exit*`
* For more details for each command, you can view <<Basic Features>>.


[[Features]]
== Features
To use the features, you need to key in the commands in the Command Box.

=== Command Format

****
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the *parameters to be supplied* by you

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g. For `*add* n/NAME`, NAME is a parameter which can be used as `*add* n/John Doe`.

* Items in *square brackets* are *optional*

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g `*add* n/NAME [$/PRICE]` can be used as `*add* n/John Doe $/40` or as `*add* n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be *used multiple times* including zero times

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g. `*findmissing* [FIELD]...` can be used as `*findmissing*` (i.e. no field is supplied), `*findmissing* phone email`

* Parameters can be in *any order*

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For advanced users, a *shorter alias* for most commands exist to reduce typing. These are provided in the information for each command.
****

=== Basic Features

==== Viewing help : `*help*`
At any time if you are unsure of how to use STUtor, this command will bring you to the help page.

Format: `*help*`


// tag::add[]
==== Adding a person: `*add*` or `*a*`
Adds a new person to STUtor. +
You can add a person with the following fields: NAME, PHONE, EMAIL, ADDRESS, SUBJECT, LEVEL, PRICE and ROLE.

** These information is displayed as tags for easy reference.
**  Upon adding to STUtor, all persons will have a default STATUS of "Not Matched".
****

[NOTE]
====
Only the NAME field is required for the command to be accepted, all other fields are optional. +
To fill in the other fields later, you can use the edit command to edit the person with the new information. +
