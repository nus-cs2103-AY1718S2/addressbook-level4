== PROJECT: Employees Tracker

---

== Overview

Employees Tracker (E.T.) is a *Human Resource Manager* application that helps managers to manage their subordinates. Its
has 2 main functionalities: providing information about employees, as well as helping in tracking the tasks assigned to
each employee.

Its User Interface (UI) is a hybrid of Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). That said, ET will suit you better if you can type fast and are familiar with CLI.

=== Enhancement Added: Lock and Unlock System

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=unlock]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=lock]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Employees Tracker is a locked by default application in order to prevent the data from unauthorized access. With the lock-unlock system, only the application owner(typically, the manager) can access the application with a unlock password only known to him.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Data Encryption

For now, the application's password and employees' information are in plaintext and visible to others besides the user. It is crucial to
to do data encryption to secure the data from leaking. I am proposing to add a new class `Crypto` which is used to encrypt and decrypt the
data. Refer to the diagram below:
