== Introduction

Your TA is an address book application designed to amplify the capabilities of a university teaching assistant or tutor.
It aims to provide all the essential functions needed to manage the administrative duties of handling a class as well as
to aid the tutor to better connect with the class. It includes a calendar, scheduling capabilities, as well as the ability to mark
attendance and participation as well.

== How to contribute to Your TA?

=== New Developers

You may wish to refer to the Section 3: <<Setting up, Setting up>>
to properly set up the Your TA project file.

Read through the rest of the guide to familiarise yourself with how Your TA components functions together.

Try making some enhancements or edits to a component and make a Pull Request (PR) to our repo! We will take a look at your PR and
give you some feedback or even merge your code if it's great.

=== Experienced Developers

The Developer Guide contains the design of the models that make up the program. Each section also details how each and every functionality
is implemented and how it interacts with the different models. We would greatly appreciate your help in fine-tuning the components and also
welcome any suggestions or feedback to improve Your TA.

== Setting up

This section contains the steps needed to properly set up the required files to work on the program source code and to ensure the application runs properly.

=== Prerequisites

The following are essential programs and libraries needed to start developing Your TA.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

. Sufficient *Java* and *Javafx* knowledge
+
[NOTE]
This application is written in Java and Javafx. A good amount of experience with the language (about 10k lines of code written in *Java* and *Javafx*) is required to understand and work in the application.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

Please follow the steps below to download and set up the project.

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Run the following steps to ensure that you successfully set up the project.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

You should see in the console that all the tests have successfully completed.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

The following configurations should be set up before you start coding to ensure a uniform coding style.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B1/main` repository. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B1/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section will present to you the high-level design view of Your TA.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above (Figure 1) explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* Initializes the components in the correct sequence at the app launch, and connects them up with each other.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Login, *`Login`*>>: Authenticates access to App.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the last four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 2 given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ (Figure 3) below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Login]]
=== Login Component
.Interactions for Login Component
image::Login.png[width="800"]

Upon launching the app, the Login component (as seen in Figure 5) takes in two inputs from the user: `Username` and `Password`, then stores the user's login credentials into a `.xml` file.
[Optional] `.xml` file is encrypted.

* The login credentials are therefore immutable (cannot be changed).
* The same username and password have to be used every time the user wishes to access the app.
* Only upon successful authentication will the app load data from the `Storage` Component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As seen in Figure 6, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TodoListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarView` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.


.Layout of the UI
image::UiLayout.png[width="800"]

As seen above in Figure 7 is the current layout of the UI of the program.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component loads the layout of each part from the `.fxml` file and then does the bindings to various variables in the address book model in the corresponding `.java` file.

[NOTE]
It may be difficult to edit the `.fxml` file directly. *Javafx* http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/[Scene Builder] is recommended to be used to edit or create new `.fxml` files.

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

Figure 8 below shows how the `LogicManager` functions in the application.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Figure 9 below shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>

[[fig-LogicCommandClassDiagram]]
.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 10 below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

Figure 11 shows the different components and interfaces that make up the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Address Book data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Person` Class:

* Stores the information of a specific person (student) in the AddressBook
* Information includes: Name, Matriculation Number, Phone Number, Email, Address and different tags to associate with that person.
* Implements `UniquePersonList` that enforces uniqueness of its elements and disallows nulls.
* `Name`: Object that stores the name of the `Person` Object.
[NOTE]
Person's name should only contain alphanumeric characters, and should not be null.
* `Matriculation Number`: Object that stores the matriculation number of the `Person` Object.
[NOTE]
Matriculation number should start with either 'A' or 'U', followed by 7 digits and ending with an alphabet (A-Z).
* `Phone Number`: Object that stores the phone number of the `Person` Object.
* `Email`: Object that stores the email address of the `Person` Object.
[NOTE]
Email address should be of the format _local-part@domain_.

The `Tag` Class,

* An immutable object that has to be valid.
* Checks are implemented to guarantee validity.
[TIP]
For every `Person` object, there can be multiple (or zero) tags.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Help feature
==== Current Implementation

The help command opens a new window, opening the user guide.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`.
It would then proceed to restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption (Coming in v2.0)

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Email (Since v1.1)

This feature allows the user to call their desktop mail application from the application itself, with the mailTo: field already populated with the user input.

==== Current implementation

image::EmailComponentFlow.png[width="800"]
pass:[<div align="center"><b>Figure 3.3.1: Email Implementation</b></div>]

The user will enter a command `email 1` to the application where the application displays a list of the students entered.
The value `1` represents the first person in the list, `2` would be the second person and so on. It will then send the student's email address
which is stored inside the application to the default mail application such as to populate the mailTo: field.

The application will then rely on `AddressBookparser` and `EmailCommandParser` to
parse the argument. The argument will be passed into the EmailCommand when it will be checked on whether the argument is valid. From there, it will
call the Java `Desktop` class to launch the user's default mail application.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the email is sent

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the Java `Desktop` class to open the default mail app
** Pros: It is fast and works with supported Desktop and OS.
** Cons: Does not work on systems wihtout a default Desktop mail application.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the in-built browser
** Pros: Higher level of compatibility, means it can be used with a wider range of operating systems.
** Cons: Clunky as users may use different web mail services. The API would also differ based on the email they use as well.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v1.3)

Support for writing the subject title in the application as well by adding an extra parameter such as `email 1 s/ [SUBJECT]`.

=== Display Picture (Since v1.2)

This feature allows the user to enter a path to their selected image file and copies the image into the `images\displayPic` folder. This image
will be shown in the application next to the details of the person. This uses the `add` command with the addition of a `dp/` parameter.

==== Current implementation

The application will take in the argument through `dp/ [PATH TO IMAGE]`.
[NOTE]
An example of a `[PATH TO IMAGE]` would be C:\Users\Desktop\Image.jpg

If this is empty, the application will default to using the default profile picture
which is in `src\resources\images\displayPic`. If an valid path to an image is provided, the image will be processed and copied over to the `data` folder where the
`addressbook.xml` is stored as well.

The image copied over will be stored with a SHA-256 hash name. This hash is calculated over the `Person` object's details to ensure a unique filename.
The `DisplayPic` object will store the relative filepath to this new duplicated image. If there is no image or a valid filepath, the `DisplayPic` object will contain the
relative filepath to the default display picture.

===== Editing a Display Picture

The image can be edited by using the `edit` command with the additional parameter of `dp/`.
The application will read in the new image to edit and use the `filepath` of the original image to generate a new unique hash name. This is to prevent the overwriting
of image files such as to facilitate the `undo` command.

===== Deleting a Display Picture

The current delete uses Java's `deleteOnExit` method. It will be updated later on in v1.4 to ensure that files are only deleted when they will definitely not be used.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Filepath to the image
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy the image file over to a designated location
** Pros: The user does not need to maintain the image file, as the application does so itself.
** Cons: User has to delete the original file if not there will be 2 of the same files on the user's storage.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the location of the file the user put in
** Pros: Potentially less space utilized.
** Cons: User needs to ensure the file is not moved or deleted.

===== Aspect: Filename of the image
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a hashing algorithm to name the file.
** Pros: SHA-256 provides collision resistant which means the filename would be unique and it is easy to implement.
** Cons: It is difficult to manually check which `Person` the image file belongs to.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the name of the `Person` to name the file.
** Pros: Image files can be easily identified separately and easy to implement.
** Cons: Could lead to potential image files overwriting each other without additional checks.

==== Future enhancements

* Support for photo frames and undo for delete (Coming in v1.4)
* Support for frame color to highlight student status (Coming in v1.5)

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file. (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

Use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* To run the tests, You need to open a console or terminal and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
Detailed information on how to run tests using Gradle is specified in <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>>.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit Tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit Tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration Tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of Unit and Integration Tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for Build Automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. +
See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When there are changes to asciidoc files in a pull request, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. +
See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*: Tech-Savvy University Teachers/Tutors

* have the need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing over mouse input
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app, includes to-do
    list features (with prioritization, etc.) and scheduling (with calendar and reminders)

=== Feature contribution

*Wu Di*

* *Major*: Implement the todo list

** Support adding, editing and deleting of tasks
** Works with undo/redo functions

This enables the tutor to view all tasks in one glance so that he/she is able to stay organized and productive.

* *Minor*: Import feature to migrate data from an external file

** Imports data anywhere in any OS

This helps the tutor work on different devices with the unique data set.

* *Minor*: add the alias feature to some of the commands

** Support majority of commands

This helps the tutor remember the commands intuitively and type them more efficiently.

*Daniel*

* *Major*: Calendar and Scheduler for user

** Supports adding of new tasks that will be slotted into the calendar(if it has a deadline)
** Also assigns a priority value to each task based on parameters keyed in when task is added

This helps the tutor to keep track of what needs to be done and which task to focus on.

* *Minor*: Person has new parameter - Matriculation number

** Person now stores matriculation number of the person
** Add command supports adding person with matriculation number(compulsory parameter)
** Find command supports search by matriculation number

This helps the tutor to easily search for a certain student by their unique matriculation number instead of just
their names (e.g. easier than searching for a common name such as Daniel).

*Pearlissa*

* *Major*: Login feature

** Implements new User package
** [Not confirmed] Encryption of data files containing usernames and passwords

This allows multiple tutors to store their data in separate accounts, which can only be accessed by them.

* *Minor*: Sorting of contacts based on selected parameters

** Any number of parameters (at least 1), and in order of priority

This allows tutors to be better able to go through their lists of students.

*Ellery*

* *Major*: Display picture for all students entered

** Support adding, editing and deleting of picture
** Also works with the redo/undo function

This helps the tutor keep track of his students, and be able to easily remember them better.

* *Minor*: Email feature to email students

** Email multiple students quickly

This helps the tutor to quickly bring up an email client to send an email to a student.
