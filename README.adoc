* Welcome to Employees Tracker (E.T.)! E.T. is a *Human Resource Manager* desktop application
that helps managers to manage their subordinates. Its has 2 main functionalities: providing information about employees,
as well as helping in tracking the tasks assigned to each employee. Its User Interface (UI) is a hybrid of Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). That said, ET will suit you better
if you can type fast and are familiar with CLI.
* Do not hesitate, let's see what ET can do!
