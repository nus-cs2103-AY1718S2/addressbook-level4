== Introduction

_EduBuddy_ is a desktop application designed for secondary school teachers *to store and manage student records*.
More importantly, _EduBuddy_ is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a
Command Line Interface(CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _EduBuddy_ can get your student profile management tasks done faster
than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Proceed on to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
Not quite sure how to get started? This section helps to guide you through the necessary steps
to get _EduBuddy_ up and running.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EduBuddy.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T09-B1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the downloaded jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for _EduBuddy_.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

+

[NOTE]
A EduBuddy folder will be created in your operating system's home directory to facilitate debugging for advanced users.

At this point, _EduBuddy_ should be successfully set up. Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`list` or `l`* : lists all students
* *`sort` `name`* : sorts the list of students by name
* **`delete` or `d`** `3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app


[IMPORTANT]
-The person must be re-selected for the information in the profile to be updated!!

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

-Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
-Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.


[[Features]]
== Features

This section provides the information of all the useful and interesting features that _EduBuddy_ has to offer.

Here are the guidelines that you may wish to follow when typing in commands. +

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`. +
* Parameters can be in *any order* e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME ic/S9500186H`, `ic/S9500186H n/NAME` is also acceptable. +
* Items in square brackets are *optional*. e.g `n/NAME [t/CLASS]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/1A` or as `n/John Doe`. +
* Command input is *case insensitive*, e.g `fInD Alex` and `find Alex` works the same. +
