== Introduction

AddSurance is for insurance agents who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts with current or potential clients*. More importantly, AddSurance is *optimized for insurance agents who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AddSurance can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
