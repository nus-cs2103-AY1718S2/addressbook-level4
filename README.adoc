* This is a desktop Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a simple Java application intended for social workers to help them plan their day and keep track of their patients and beneficiaries.
* Some key features of this application include data encryption, secure sign-on, an patient address book, user session reporting, calendar, daily scheduling,
and navigation tools.


== Target Audience
SLAP aims to target social workers who have to visit different less privileged families and/or high-risk
stay-at-home patients as their daily routine. SLAP allow them to organise their schedule for the day as
they may have to visit multiple locations, take copious notes and help in many different ways.
