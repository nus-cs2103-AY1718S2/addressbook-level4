== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced *find command to support a variety of search patterns*
** What it does: The `find` command allows the user to search for a student easily through exact keyword match, fuzzy keyword match or wildcard keyword match.
** Justification: This feature is important as users might be managing a large number of contacts and finding the contacts that they desire is not easy.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves adding new predicates on top of existing ones. Various new classes are created to manage and process the new predicates. A singleton pattern class `FindResults` is created to store find results and provide utility functions for parsing predicates.

* *Minor enhancement*: added `Major` and `GradePointAverage` fields to all students. These fields affect the `add` command and are editable by the `edit` command. They are crucial details that affect the hiring decision of an university student.
