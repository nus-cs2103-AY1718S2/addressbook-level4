== Introduction

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their tasks and events.
CLIndar is *Common-Line Interface (CLI) based and uses Linux-style commands*, which computing students are familiar with.
Thus, compared to traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications, CLIndar is faster and provides more convenience for computing students.

With CLIndar, you can:

* Keep track of your tasks and events and be reminded of their due dates.
* Record all completed tasks and events, so that you know what you have done.

The current version of CLIndar is 1.5 and is available on Windows and Linux Operating Systems.

== Get Started

To start using CLIndar, follow the instructions below.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

.  Download the latest `CLIndar.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CLIndar.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as seen below.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

* *`task`* `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 d/16/03/2018 17:00 r/Enhance major component`: adds Software Engineering task to Desk Board.
* *`event`* `n/Software Project s/01/05/2018 8:00 e/01/08/2018 8:00 l/School of Computing`: adds Software Project event to Desk Board.
* *`ls task`* : lists all uncompleted tasks.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of commands in CLIndar.

[[Features]]
== Features

The following describes the command format in CLIndar:

* *Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.* +
For example, in the following format `task n/NAME`,
  `NAME` must be supplied by the user as the task name. The following is an example of the command to be keyed in by user:
  `task n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.

* *Items in square brackets are optional.* +
For example,  `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 r/urgent` or as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.

* *Parameters can be in any order.* +
For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATETIME`, `d/DATETIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.

`clear` +
`u` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`u` (reverses the `rm task 1` command) +
`r` (reapplies the `rm task 1` command) +
