== PROJECT: TeachConnect

---

== Overview
TeachConnect is a contact and schedule management application designed for teachers and educational professionals. TeachConnect is designed to best aid users who prefer to enter input using keyboard instead of the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This portfolio was made to document all contribution I have made to this project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added Appointment & Task feature.
** What it does:
*** It allows the user to store their appointments and tasks in TeachConnect.
*** It allows the user to check the date and time of their appointments easily on the UI's Calendar.
** Justification: This feature can help teachers keeping track of any upcoming appointment or task they have. This can be useful for teachers or teaching associates who frequently need to meet up with students and parents for counselling or administrative purposes.
** Highlights: This enhancement modifies the existing model to store `Task` and `Appointment`. It also modified the UI significantly by integrating in a calendar, so that all appointment can be rendered on the calendar.
** Credits: The calendar in the UI was taken from third party library `CalendarFX`.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a change theme command that allows the user to change them of the GUI.
