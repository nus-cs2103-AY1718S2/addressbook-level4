Missed a learning outcome because it was so deeply nested in the pool of information? Can't find the information you need from just a simple click? We know how that feels. With our Progress Checker, you'll never experience these issues in CS2103/T again.

* This is a desktop Progress Checker application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students taking module CS2103/T as a means of tracking both their learning outcomes and practice exercises.
* It is meant to be a helper software used together with the https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/website/index.html[official CS2103/T module website].
