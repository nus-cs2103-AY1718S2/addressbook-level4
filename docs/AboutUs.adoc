ProgressChecker was developed by the https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T09-B3/main[T09-B3] team. +
ProgressChecker helps to remind students learning outcomes every week. +
With a simple click, students will never miss their weekly LOs again. +
It also keeps track of the progress of each team member. +
Thus it is convenient for teammates to compare help each other. +

We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
