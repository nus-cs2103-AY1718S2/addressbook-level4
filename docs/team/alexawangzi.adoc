== PROJECT: STUtor - v1.5

---

== Overview

STUtor -v1.5 is a desktop application targeting tutor coordinators
to help them _match_ and _manage_ a large database of tutors and students. +
The user can perform actions such as adding/ removing a person, editing and viewing
personal information, matching a student with a tutor, and so on. +
The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. +
The application is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major Enhancement

* Added the ability to *match/unmatch a student with a tutor*
** What it does:
allows the user to choose a student and a tutor and match them.
Compatibilty checking will be done to ensure validity of the pair(must be one student and one tutor,
must be of the same subject, etc).
Similarly, the user can choose a currently matched pair and unmatch it.
** Justification:
This feature makes the accounting process of matching and unmatching easier,
saving time in marking individual tutor or student and updating their status.
All the user has to provide is the indices of the target student and tutor.

** Highlights:
The commands spans multiple components in the architecture of the application.
and careful thinking is required to ensure good usage of the existing classes
without increasing the coupling.
Please refer to my writings in the *"Contribution to the Developer Guide"* section for detailed explanations on implementation.


=== Minor Enhancement
* Added the ability to accept *case-insensitive input* and *shortcuts* for filling in personal information.
** What it does:
When the user is editing information of a person, he/she can type in mixed case.
Automatic conversion to <<proper-case, proper case>> will be done.
Similarly, he/she can use shortcuts, and the input will be converted to full form.
** Justification:
Since the application is CLI-based and the user has a large database to manage, a lot of typing is required.
Having shortcuts saves time for typing, and acceptance of case-insensitive input means data will be stored
and displayed in an uniform format.
