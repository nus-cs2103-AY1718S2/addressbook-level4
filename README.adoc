* This is a desktop MeetUp Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* This application is for students with group projects to keep track of their teammates' timetable and schedule the most suitable meetup time.
* Users can store person's timetables, arrange persons in groups, manage group projects' to-dos and show meetups on the calendar.
