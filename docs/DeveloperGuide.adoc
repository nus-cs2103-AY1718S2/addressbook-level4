By: `CS2103-T15-B3`      Since: `Feb 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the User Database data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::multiuser[]
=== Multi-User Feature

.Structure of the Model Component (UserDatabase Emphasis)
image::ModelClassDiagramUD.png[width="800"]

To implement the multi-user feature, where each user has his/her own Address Book, we have added a `userDatabase` in Model
to store all the available users in the application. The `userDatabase` is the same architectural level as the `addressBook`.
A similar storing system used in `addressBook` is also used for `userDatabase` where the all the user data is stored in a
single XML file.

==== Design Considerations for Database

A big design consideration is the architecture in implementing the retrieval and storage of multiple users.

*A Possible Design* +
A possible design was to store users and persons under the same data folder which means encapsulating AddressBook
in a User. In the XML data storage, the Addressbook will be an element of a User; the User Database will then be the root. +


Example:

    <userdatabase>
        <user>
            <username> user </username>
            <password> pass </password>
            <addressbook>
                <persons>
                    <name>John Doe</name>
                    <phone>98765432</phone>
                    <email>johnd@example.com</email>
                    <address>311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25</address>
                    <sessionlogs></sessionlogs>
                    <tags>ADHD</tags>
                </persons>
            </addressbook>
        </user>
    </userdatabase>


However, this may over-complicate and over populate the data storage file very fast
which can grow quite large with many users. Transportation of the data file may be an issue if the file size becomes too big.

*Current Implementation* +

.Structure of the Storage Component (UserDatabase Emphasis)
image::StorageClassDiagramUD.png[width="800"]

Currently, the User Database mimics the AddressBook classes and instances in the Model and Storage Components.

In terms of storage, the User Database of all users is now collectively stored in one XML data file. (eg. users.xml).
The addressbook of each user is now stored in separate XML files. Each addressbook data file is identified in the following
format:

`addressbook-[USERNAME].xml` where [USERNAME] refers to the username of the user

While this can be argued to be bad as there is strong coupling between the user and the addressbook data file, such is
fixed as in the absence of the addressbook data file, a sample data file will be created.

Also, there may be a security concern that a side channel information leak because an external party can figure
 out the number of active users from the number of addressbook files. However, such information is not very useful to conduct
an attack on the application.

*Other Alternative Designs*

Other alternative designs involves external third-party database systems such as SQL or no-SQL databases such as MongoDB.

==== Deleting User
One thing to highlight about the deleting of user, it also deletes the AddressBook XML data file, hence it cannot be
retrieved again. It also prevents users from accessing the file again by creating a user with the same username as the one
being deleted.

// end::multiuser[]

// tag::authentication[]
=== Authentication

==== Current Implementation

===== User Login

The Login feature involves UI, Logic and Model components. It allows the user to login and logout
from the application. When the user is logged out, the user commands are limited, some panels are hidden
the user and the viewing of history is disabled. It serves the purpose of maintaining confidentiality of the data in the application.

The `LoginCommand` is part of Logic component. However it makes use of `userDatabase` to check for the match in
the username and password input. Below is a sequence diagram of how the feature works.

.Sequence Diagram for Login Command (Logic Component)
image::LoginFeatureLogicModelComponent.png[width="800"]

The Login feature involves the UI component as well as we need to know when to hide and show certain panels depending on
whether the user has logged in or not. To maintain our n-tier architecture, we make `CommandBox` check the login
status upon each command entry to effect the change on the UI. The sequence diagram is as shown below.

.Sequence Diagram for Login Command (UI Component)
image::LoginFeatureUIComponent.png[width="800"]

When the user is not logged in, commands that manipulate data in the application will be disabled. To avoid editing
every single command, the invalidity of the command is handled in `LogicManager`.

===== User Logout

The logout feature similarly involves the UI, Logic and Model components. It allows the user to
log out from the application, securing his data.

The user cannot logout when he/she is not even logged in initially. This is already handled by limiting the availability
of commands when the user is logged out.

Similarly, some of the UI panels will be hidden when the user logs out.


===== User Login Status

To identify the login status of the application and know its the correct user, a login status bar on
the top of the window has been implemented. Its shows the status and the user that is logged in.

Example:

.Login Status Bar (Logged Out)
image::LoginStatusBarLoggedOut.png[width="800"]

.Login Status Bar (Logged In)
image::LoginStatusBarLoggedIn.png[width="800"]

==== Possible enhancements

1. Login UI Box can be implemented before launching the main window
2. Encryption of user file [coming in v2.0]
3. Salting of passwords so that it is not deterministic when hashing/encrypting
4. 2-Factor Authentication for login

// end::authentication[]


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

*Proposed Implementation* +
Basing on the current storage architecture, we could implement a FileEncryption class to handle both the encryption and
decryption when storing and retrieving the data files.

** For User Database +
Information in the user database that needs to be encrypted is the username and password. Hashing is a good encryption scheme to use,
 a two-way encryption scheme is not needed here because we only need to check the validity of the username and password.


** For Address Book +
AddressBook data files require a two-way encryption scheme as the information needs to be read when the application
initialises. A symmetric key encryption scheme is more suitable here than public key encryption scheme because less information
needs to be stored. Also, it is easy when we can use the username as the symmetric key in the encryption scheme. Some
possible schemes are AES or CBC.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::calendarview[]
=== Google Calendar Integration
Command line and graphical integration with Google Calendar from within SLAP. This assumes that the user already uses Google Calendar to manage their events.

==== Proposed Implementation
===== Aspect: GUI
The GUI portion of this feature will be a WebView of the Google Calendar web application. The user will have the option to either open their calendar as a new floating window by pressing the `F8` function key or by clicking `View > Open Calendar` or as a scene within the main SLAP GUI by invoking the `calendar` command. In either case, the WebView will be instantiated as a new JavaFX scene and take advantage of Java's build in WebView/WebEngine. This will allow the user to interact with the familiar Google Calendar web interface without any loss of functionality.

===== Aspect: CLI
The CLI portion of this feature will rely on Google's Calendar API that uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to allow an application (such as SLAP) to directly read/write to a user's calendar, provided that they have given them access to the calendar. Once a user has authorized the application to read/write to their calendar, they will gain access to the the following commands: `event-add`, `event-delete`, and `event-edit`. The Oauth authentication process will be entirely handled by Google with the only requirement being that the user must log in to their calendar using the GUI interface.

A check will eventually be added to ensure that the user has already logged in before attempting to execute any of the aforementioned commands.

UML Sequence Diagram of Proposed Command Flow For `calendar-add` Command

Every command that requires OAuth (i.e. calendar-add, calendar-delete, calendar-list, show-schedule, and reauthenticate) will follow a similar flow with the potential commision of the parse step depending on the command.

UML Activity Diagram of High Level Logic Flow For `calendar-add` Command

Every command that requires OAuth (i.e. calendar-add, calendar-delete, calendar-list, show-schedule, and reauthenticate) will follow a similar flow with the potential commision of the parse step depending on the command.

image::OauthRevisedActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: GUI
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Native Google Calendar WebView
** Pros: Minimal effort to implement as it is just a wrapper about the existing Google Calendar UI. Data is managed and secured by Google.
** Cons: Cannot customize the interface without injecting customize styles. Requires complicated OAuth 2.0 authentication to work. Assumes that the user already has a Google account.

* **Alternative 2: ** https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX]
** Pros: Can more easily create a custom UI and not rely on Google Calendar.
** Cons: Documentation does not explain how to interface with the UI / Storage. Optimal if used with Google Calendar anyway. In the absense of using Google Calendar, it would require a custom local storage layer for persistant data.

* **Alternative 3: ** http://jfxtras.org/[JFXtras]
** Pros: Simple adgenda view with relatively simple API to understand.
** Cons: Not as feature rich as the other options and would require a custom local storage layer to have persistant data.

* **Alternative 4: ** Pure CLI Interface
** Pros: Simple adgenda view with relatively simple API to understand.
** Cons: Not as feature rich as the other options and would require a custom local storage layer to have persistant data.

===== Aspect: Data Access
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use OAuth
** Pros: Can take advantage of Google's first-party Calendar APIs for seamless CLI data manipulation.
** Cons: Extremely complicated to configure and set up in a testable way.

* **Alternative 2: ** Require the user to export their existing Google Calendar and import it into the application. New events added to the SLAP calendar would not appear in their Google Calendar.
** Pros: Does not require complex authentication and is thus easier to implement. Solution works offline.
** Cons: Requires additional local storage implementations and calendar events are no longer synced to the cloud.
** Cons: Less secure due to the requirement of local storage; more prone to file loss.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddEventCommand` -> `calendar-add  [args..]`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google's Calendar API
** Pros: First-party direct access to Google Calendar data.
** Cons: Requires the user to authenticate our application before this feature works correctly.
** Cons: Requires a complex parser to make the input format more friendly for a wider range of users.

* **Alternative 2: ** Use URL Params
** Pros: Does not require Oauth and is therefore easier to implement.
** Cons: Requires the user to confirm the event addition through a GUI action, thus not allowing for a true CLI-only experience.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ViewCalendarCommand` -> `calendar-launch` and `switch calendar`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Open a Webview (either as a new window or within the main application gui)
** Pros: Low development cost as the webview exists already.
** Pros: Visually clear to the user how their calendar (and events) is organized.
** Cons: Requires an internet connection. Has no CLI-friendly output.

* **Alternative 2: ** List events in the CLI (see next consideration)
** Pros: CLI-only friendly. Does not require a webview and thus makes the application less resource intensive.
** Cons: Higher development cost as it becomes necessary to format the response from Google's APIs (and write a new set of logic to parse and format the data.)

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ViewCalendarEventsCommand` -> `calendar-list`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** CLI Output
** Pros: Provides a command-line friendly way to view upcoming calendar events.
** Cons: Much higher development cost as it was necessary to parse and format the response from Google's APIs.
** Cons: Requires OAuth.
** Cons: Less visually clear to the user how their events are spaced out temporally.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new calendar interface similar to the Contacts Pane
** Pros: Pros: Visually easy to parse and thematically in line with the overall design language of the application.
** Cons: Requires a significant implementation change to adapt the UI due to the non-locally stored nature of the data from Google.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ViewCalendarEventsForParticularDayCommand` -> `show-schedule [args..]`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** CLI Output
** Pros: Can adapt `calendar-list` command but increase specificity.
** Pros: Can pass this data to the daily scheduler feature to minimize duplicate code generation.
** Cons: Less visually clear to the user how their events are spaced out temporally.
** Cons: Requires OAuth.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new calendar interface similar to the Contacts Pane
** Pros: Visually easy to parse and thematically in line with the overall design language of the application.
** Pros: Can reuse the `calendar-list` alternative 2 code if that route is decided upon.
** Cons: Requires a significant implementation change to adapt the UI due to the non-locally stored nature of the data from Google.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `EditEventCommand` -> `calendar-edit` [Coming in v2.0]
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google's Calendar API
** Pros: First-party direct access to Google Calendar data.
** Cons: Requires the user to authenticate our application before this feature works correctly.

* **Alternative 2: ** Only allow for graphical editing
** Pros: No implementation required as everything happens through the spawned webview.
** Cons: No CLI-friendly output. More resource intensive on the end-user's system.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteEventCommand` -> `calendar-delete [args..]`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google's Calendar API
** Pros: First-party direct access to Google Calendar data.
** Pros: Scales well with multiple users (sandboxed credential authorization).
** Cons: Requires the user to authenticate our application before this feature works correctly.

* **Alternative 2: ** Only allow for graphical deleting
** Pros: No implementation required as everything happens through the spawned WebView.
** Cons: No CLI-friendly output. More resource intensive on the end-user's system.
** Cons: Does not scale well with multiple users.

=== Map Components
==== Current Implementation

The map view feature is implemented using `GMapsFX`, an imported library created by https://github.com/rterp/GMapsFX[rterp]. The library contains basic integration of Google Maps APIs into FMXL files.
The feature supports the display and retrieval of addresses as a marker and of directions on the various Google Map components implemented across the application. There are two main instances of Map: in `Details` Feature and `Daily Scheduler` Feature.

Each map is loaded a separately as independent `MapPanels` with their own `MapManager`, located in `logic` folder managing them. Switching out of feature will unload the respective `MapPanel`, required due to limitations of API used.

image::MapPanelSelectionSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The above sequence diagram represents the process of loading and setting a new marker on the map panel within Person Details panel.
The feature can create markers to pin beneficiary location on map and also display suggested navigation routes between event locations.

As the Map Panel is a UI component, adopting the event-driven approach, we have made it such that the parent of the Map Panel
listens for the `PersonPanelSelectionChangeEvent` to signal the child Map Panel to load a load/set a new address on the map.

The Google geocoding service helps to translate the string address into a proper Geocode request for Google to process.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: GUI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `GMapsFX`
** Pros: Intuitive to use. Collated various Google Map APIs to be compatible with JavaFX. Sufficient for displaying and controlling simple usage of Google Maps. Once loaded, the map does not require further initialisation calls to load different address.
** Cons: Documentation is at times unclear. Several methods are designed as lambda expressions but not specified in documentation. Limited flexibility. Can only load one map at a time.
* **Alternative 2:** Use WebView component and load HTML file containing simple embedded Google Maps
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Requires re-loading for each call to view different person. Lacking in control. Application cannot communicate efficiently to loaded pages. Easy to break. Inflexible.
* **Alternative 3:** Integrate Google Maps APIs directly
** Pros: Well-documented. Full-access to Google Maps APIs allows for great flexibility.
** Cons: Too complicated. Not built/compatible for JavaFX. Cannot load more than one map at a time.

===== Aspect: Logic

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain a non-static `MapManager` in `logic` to handle manipulation of Map.
** Pros: Cleaner code. Each `MapPanel` maintains their own logic controller. Avoids asynchronous event/callback errors.
** Cons: May have issues with retrieving correct data. Have to instantiate new `MapManager` for every instance of Map.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a static Map logic manager that is called only when required.
** Pros: Not all map instances require a dedicated MapManager to handle requests.
** Cons: GMapsFX has limitations in using static class, attributes has to be reset for each Map.
// end::mapComponents[]

// tag::dailyScheduler[]
=== Daily Scheduler
==== Current Implementation

Feature includes a list of scheduled events for the specified day in addition to the aforementioned maps implemented using `GMapsFX`, an imported library created by https://github.com/rterp/GMapsFX[rterp].

`Daily Scheduler` feature involves two separate sections,`Events List Display` and `Navigation`. The display portion focuses on retrieving events of the specified date whereas the navigation portion seeks to retrieve suggested routes between those events.

The `Daily Scheduler` feature will involve the UI component as while as the Model component, and makes use of `OAuthManager` to get required events.
The OAuthManager is only used in the parser of the navigate command to retrieve the relevant event pairs.

image::LoadDirectionsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The above sequence diagram represents the process of loading and setting new direction markers on the map panel within Daily Scheduler panel.
This happens after the parsing and doing the execution of `navigate` command where `LoadDirectionsEvent` is posted as an event.

The DailySchedulerPanel, being the parent of the directionPanel, listens for the event and will update the map panel accordingly.

// end::dailyScheduler[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Our SLAP aims to target social workers who have to visit different less privileged families and/or high-risk
stay-at-home patients as their daily routine. Social workers regularly make visits to these beneficiaries to assist them
 in overcoming obstacles in their lives.

Our SLAP will allow them to organise their schedule for the day as they may have to visit multiple locations, take
copious notes and help in many different ways. For example, a social worker may have to pick a victim of domestic abuse
up in the morning to take her to the lawyer’s office to file for a divorce from her abusive husband and after taking her
 home, the social worker might have to visit another family to check on a disabled patient.


* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* handles sensitive contacts
* plans and manages their daily visits on desktop
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*:

* manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
* easily add and manage calendar events without a full-blown application experience
* organize key meetings and keep track of key contacts in one place
* able to provide routes from one location to another
* uses minimal system resources
* more secure than a traditional address book

*Feature contribution:*

**Jason Jerome Manson-Hing**

`Major Feature:` Calendar Integration
* Functional calendar within the application with add/view/delete functionality.
* This is useful for social workers to keep track of all of the things that they have to do now and in the future.
This calendar will be seperate from their personal calendar so as to keep business and personal information seperate.
Additionally, this calendar will integrate with the daily scheduler function to help optimize their time in a day.

`Minor Feature:` Daily Scheduler (Events)
* Allows the user to view their events for a particular day.
* Supplies the data for the daily scheduler routing (navigation)


`Minor Feature:` View Error Log in App
* Allows the user to view the application's error from within the application itself.
* This is useful as it allows an advanced user to send the application developer a log of the events that occurred before an exception was encountered.
* This feature is unobtrustive as the information contained within the log is essentially meaningless to everyone except for the developer. Additionally, the command is relatively hard to invoke accidentally, and thus has a low chance of being discovered. Additionally, this command only shows read-only information and thus cannot cause any harm to the system.
* This feature is useful so that if the user encounters an issue and wishes to help provide more information, they can relatively easily retrieve this information without much effort provided they are instructed on how to do so. It is unlikely that a user will encounter this feature by accident.

**Chan Jin Jia**

`Major Feature:` Map Location and Daily Scheduler

* As our application aims to better the day-to-day operations of a social worker, integrating maps into our application
greatly aids their visitation process. This integration aims to make the locating of beneficiaries much more convenient.
* A vital feature to any social worker will be that of a daily scheduler that lists their scheduled events for the day.
Not only does the daily scheduler collates the user's list of calendar events for the day into an easily consumable view,
the daily scheduler feature of our app will also display the suggested route between event locations or beneficiary addresses to facilitate ease of movement.
* Allows the social worker to plan the most optimal route of travel for their beneficiary visits for the day and creates the
optimal schedule for them.

`Minor Feature:` Main GUI and CSS

* In addition, a cleaner Main UI will be required to better display our Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for
Social Worker application as it will contain several major features (beneficiary details, calendar, and daily
scheduler).
* On the details feature, map is loaded to display address of beneficiary and a panel of previous session logs are loaded
to remind social worker of previous sessions with the beneficiary.
* The scheduler feature contains indicators on the right of the map to provide visual cues of the number of journeys required for the day.

**Kaiser Tan**

`Major feature:` User Login and Multi-User capabilities

* The application will support multiple users and each having their own addressbook. This is a step towards allowing our application
to be used as a centralised application used by institute of social workers.
* User can also login and logout safely, preventing external users from accessing the SLAP without authorisation
* As a social worker, he/she should be able to secure SLAP and only ensure that it is only accessible to him/her, hence a login function
is needed to maintain the C-I-A security framework.

`Minor feature:` Adding Session Reports/Logs

* This feature allows the social worker to add logs to the SLAP.
* The session reports/logs feature is a crucial feature for our target audience of social workers.
* A social worker should be able to add their reports for their patient for each session, so that he/she have a consolidated
view of all their reports specific to the patient. This allows for convenience and easy tracking on the progress of
their patients.
