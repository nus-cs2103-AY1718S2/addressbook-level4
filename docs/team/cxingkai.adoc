== PROJECT: Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB)

---

== Overview

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is a desktop application used by clinics for managing health records digitally.
Doctors can use it to check for a patient's health profile, and medical staff can use it to manage queues and patient appointments.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface, and it has a Graphical User Interface created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *login command*.
** What it does: Opens a window that allows users to log into IMDB. Some commands can only be executed when logged in as a particular user role.
** Justification: Adds a layer of security, protecting sensitive information of patients from users without security clearance.
** Highlights: Implementing this command was challenging as it involved handling data input from another window, using a static class LoginManager to authenticate and store login information.
This feature can also be extended in the future by adding additional user roles such as administrator.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the *print command*.
** What it does: Prints a selected user's medical records as a pdf file.
** Justification: Can be used by doctors to explain a patient's medical condition.
** Highlights: This command can be extended to include graphical information like x-ray images.
** Credits: iText 5 was used to create the pdf file.
