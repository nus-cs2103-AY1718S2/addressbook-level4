== Introduction
// comment: add a logo for flashy?
Flashy, lightning fast flashcard management.
// comment: better one liners?
[TIP]
====
What are flashcards? Traditionally physical flashcards are actual cards that people use to help memorise things.
The front will have a question prompt and the back will have an answer.
====
// comment: Other ways to explain flashcard?
Physical cards are bulky and hard to search for. They are also very difficult to organise. Flashy is the result of our desire to eliminate these challenges that arise from the use of conventional flashcards. Flashy helps you organise your flashcards using its *tagging* system. By associating flashcards to different tags, Flashy is able to retrieve all flashcards of a given tag in a flash.

Studies have shown that *spaced repetition* is far more effective than regular studying.
And thus we gave Flashy an intelligent scheduler to help space out your study sessions and make them more effective.
// comment: do we want to add Italisization for Flashy?
// comment: how do we reference special words like spaced repetition?

Although Flashy is best suited for language learners,
it is able to handle thousands of cards. Therefore, Flahsy should prove useful for any student hoping to improve their flashcard organisation.

Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* *`exit` or `quit`* : exits the application

Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter down the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.

Cards can have multiple tags.

=== Managing Cards
=== Adding a flashcard: `addc`

Adds a flashcard to Flashy. The presence of `o/OPTION` parameters will determine whether it is a normal or MCQ-type flashcard. +
Format: `addc f/FRONT b/BACK t/TAG` or +
`addc f/FRONT o/OPTION o/OPTION .. b/BACK t/TAG`

Examples:

* `addc f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy t/Trivia` +
Adds a normal flashcard with the front and back of the first card being `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, as well as tagging it as `Trivia`.
* `addc f/Which continent is Singapore in? o/Asia o/Africa o/Australia o/South America b/1` +
Adds a MCQ-type flashcard with the front being `Which continent is Singapore in?`, options includes `Asia`, `Africa`, `Australia` and `South America` and back being `1`.

[TIP]
A flashcard can have any number of tags (including 0).
[CAUTION]
Ensure that the parameter for `b/` falls between 1 the number of options inclusive.

==== Editing a normal flashcard : `editc`

Edits an existing flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editc INDEX [f/FRONT] [b/BACK]`

****
* Edits the normal flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
****

Examples:

* `editc 1 f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy` +
Edits the front and back of the 1st flashcard to be `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`.

[CAUTION]
Do ensure that the flashcard at the specified index is a normal card, or else an error would occur.

==== Editing a MCQ-type flashcard : `editm`

Edits an existing MCQ-type flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editm INDEX [f/FRONT] [o/OPTION_NUMBER/OPTION] [o/OPTION_NUMBER/OPTION] ... [b/BACK]`

****
* Edits the MCQ-type flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
****

Examples:

* `editm 1 f/When is National Day in Singapore? o/2/9th July o/3/10th July` +
Edits the front of the 1st flashcard to be `How many legs does an insect have?` as well as edits option number 2 and 3 to be `9th July` and `10th July`  respectively.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`.

[CAUTION ]
Do ensure that the flashcard at the specified index is a MCQ-type card, or else an error would occur.

==== Deleting a flashcard : `deletec`

Deletes the specified flashcard. +
Format: `deletec INDEX`

****
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

`deletec 2` +
Deletes the 2nd flashcard in the list.

=== Using flashcard
After adding and managing your flashcards, its time to get your A+!
This section will teach you how to let Flashy's intelligent scheduling algorithm prompt you the best time to study!

==== Showing a flashcard : `show`

Reveals the answer of the flashcard identified by the index number used in the list. +
Format: `show INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `show 2` +
Shows the 2nd flashcard in the list.
* `show 1` +
Shows the 1st flashcard in the list.

==== Answering flashcards: `Schedule`
Answer to give feedback to the scheduling algorithm to schedule the cards for future review.

Format: `schedule CONFIDENCE`

****
* The confidence can only be 0, 1, 2.
* `show` cammand must be used first before `schedule` can be used.
****

There are 3 `CONFIDENCE` levels

* `answer 0` +
Go again. I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer 1` +
Pass. I kind of know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer 2` +
Easy A+. Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.

[TIP]
====
This gives feedback to the scheduler algorithm to automatically schedule the card for review at a time when it thinks you are likely to forget it.

This design is based off the well known forgetting curve, you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve
====

Examples:

* `schedule 1` +
Card will be resheduled into near future.

==== Show flashcards for review: `Today`
Lists and show flashcards due for review today.

Format: `Today`

Example:

* `Today`

Lists and show flashcards due for review today.

=== Managing Tags
==== Selecting a tag : `select`

Selects the tag identified by the index number. This will show only flashcards with the tag selected. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.

****

Examples:

* `select 2` +
Selects the 2nd tag in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st tag in the list.

==== Filtering tags: `find`

Filters the tag list to contain those that match the search terms. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====
The search is case-insensitive, and finds exact partial matches to the tag name. For example, `bio` would match `Biology`.
====

Examples:

* `find biology` will show only tags matching the word `biology`. This will match `Biology`, `biology`, and `Biology Midterms`, and not `bio`, or `chemistry`.

==== Editing a tag : `edit`

* Color must be a string of length 6 specifying a link:https://htmlcolorcodes.com/[hex color code]. For example, the color white is represented as `FFFFFF`.
* The existing name of the tag will be replaced with the value that was entered.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 t/French` +
Changes the name of the first tag in the list to `French`.
* `edit 2 t/German c/FF5733` +
Changes the name of the second tag in the list to `German` and the color of the tag to a shade of orange.
