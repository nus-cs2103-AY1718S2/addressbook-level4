== PROJECT: reInsurance

---

== Overview

reInsurance is the premier organizational tool for insurance agents around the world. Allowing easy access and management of client information, reInsurance sets out to simplify the mundane administrative tasks of an insurance agent.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added an export feature to the reInsurance application
** What it does: the newly added export feature allows the user to export internal data from the application to an outside source. More specifically, the two major pieces of data to export are the calendar events and the portfolio of clients.
** Justification: This feature is crucial to the application since it allows for the reInsurance users to access important data stored in the application when they are unable to use the actual application itself (i.e. when using a mobile phone or computer with reInsurance application).
** Highlights: This enhancement builds off already existing features of the reInsurance application and its data. Other parts of the application were fairly unaffected by the enhancement. However, as the reInsurance application grows and stores more information, there are many possible upgrades to be made to the export feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a count command to view the total number of persons in the reInsurance application.
