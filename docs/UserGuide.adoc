== Introduction

Retail Analytics (RA) is for *retailers who handle hundreds to thousands of customers and orders and who are comfortable with using a desktop app to manage their analytics*. More importantly, RA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RA can get your customer analytics tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Retail Analytics.

[TIP]
An order must have at least one suborder. Prices are recorded separately to prevent retroactive sales figure changes when product prices are modified after an order has been made.

Examples:

* `addorder e/alex@example.com o/1 2 $3` adds an order where alex bought 2 pieces of product whose id is 1 for $3 each.
* `addorder e/bernice@example.com o/1 1 $1 o/2 1 $1` adds an order where alex bought 1 of product 1 for $1 and 1 of product 2 for $1, making $2 total.

=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +

Format: `findproductbycategory CATEGORY`

Example:

* `findproductbycategory Clothing` finds all products of category `Clothing`

=== Finding product recommendations for a person: `recommend`
Given a person, analyzes the app's entire order history to train a predictive model that guesses which products are likely to appeal to a given person. Outputs a list of (`productId`, `predicted chance of purchase`), ranked in descending order of chance of purchase. +

An analogous real-world use would be how companies like Amazon know which products to recommend you in their targeted emails. +

(For V1.5rc) - Does not recommend items a person has already bought. +
(For V2.0) - Introduce more features other than age and gender.+

Format: `recommend INDEX`

[TIP]
The sample data provided includes an order history of mostly younger persons buying `TrendyShirt`, older persons buying `Dentures`, females buying `Lipstick`, and a general audience for `Toothbrush`. You can casually validate the algorithm by noticing that the recommendations for a younger person ranks `TrendyShirt` at the front of the output, while `Dentures` will be right at the rear. Experiment by adding different persons, products, and orders, and see how he recommendations respond!

Example

* `recommend 1` finds recommendations for person whose last shown index is 1.
