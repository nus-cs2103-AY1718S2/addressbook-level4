== PROJECT: Infinity Book

---

== Overview

Infinity Book (IB) is an address book application for tech recruiters who prefer to use a desktop application to manage their candidates. +

IB provides recruiters with an *end-to-end* recruitment solution, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews.

== Summary of contributions

. *Major enhancement*: *Job Postings*

** *What it does*: Allows the recruiter to add a job posting along with preferred location, skills, tags and position title. These jobs can be matched to candidate automatically, or edited, listed, searched and deleted.
** *Justification*: This feature makes all the information in the Infinity Book useful to a recruiter by providing a direct method to match and access relevant data for their job.
** *Highlights*:
*** For meaningful implementation of job matching, this enhancement adds a skills field to both Person and Job. This field details the skills possessed by a candidate and those required by the job.
*** This enhancement also modifies the structure of the model and data handling in the entire application has been modified to suit a Job data list in addition to Person. The implementation effected many changes to the testing tools of the Infinity Book as well.
*** Job matching is performed in a flexible manner, allowing the recruiter to ignore some fields.

. *Minor enhancement*: Auto-correct and auto-complete
** *What it does*: Allows the recruiter to auto-complete and auto-correct command words automatically.
** *Justification*: This feature allows the recruiter to interact with the command line with increased accuracy and speed.
** *Highlights*:
*** Auto-correct finds and corrects misspelt command words at one edit distance even in copy pasted commands without affecting arguments.
*** Auto-complete cycles through all possible completion on multiple key press.
