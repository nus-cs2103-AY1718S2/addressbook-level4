== Introduction

Codeducator is a desktop address book application for private programming language tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the contacts of students*. You can also use Codeducator to track the progress of your students, manage your tutoring schedule and other important information about your students. More importantly, Codeducator is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Codeducator can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
