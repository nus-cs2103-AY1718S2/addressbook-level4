== Welcome to Codeducator!

Codeducator is a desktop address book and scheduling application for private programming language tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the contacts of students*. +

You can also use Codeducator to track the progress of your students, manage your tutoring schedule and other important information about your students. More importantly, Codeducator is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Codeducator can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

==== Syncing data with your Google Account

Updates both Google Contacts and Google Calendar with Addressbook and Schedule. Deletes the old data that Codeducator
has uploaded previously, and uploads the updated data, correct as of time of entering the `sync` command. +

Google Contacts will create a new Contact Label group called "Students". Contacts from your Codeducator app will be uploaded here.
Your Student's Name, Phone Number and Address will be uploaded. +

Google Calendar will create a Calendar group called "Student Lessons". Lessons from your Calendar will be uploaded here.
The name of the event will be "Lesson with <Student>", using the Start and End times of the Lesson, location will be using the address associated with the Student.
The Calendar will only start syncing from the *first Lesson occurring after the current day* that you perform the sync. +

[NOTE]
====
If you have synced before, future syncs will +

.. Look for "Students" label in Google Contacts and delete contacts in those groups before reuploading your Student data
.. Look for "Student Lessons" calendar and delete the events in that Calendar before reuploading your Schedule data.
====

Currently, Google Calendar will create a recurring weekly event per lesson, repeated over 4 weeks. If you have no edits to your Schedule within the month, do a sync at the end of the month to refresh your Calendar data.


[WARNING]
====
. You must first be logged in to sync your data.
. A stable internet connection is required to fully upload data. If cut, there is a high probability that it won't fully upload. Please try syncing again.
. Do not change the name of the Students label. Codeducator will not be able to delete those contacts in future syncs.
. Likewise, do not change the name of the Calendar "Student Lessons" as it will be similarly used for future syncs
