By: `Team SE-EDU`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarPanel` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly. For example, the `CalendarPanel`
reponds to the `ZoomInEvent` and zooms in the `CalendarView` accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

*  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
*  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

//tag::modelComponent[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
//end::modelComponent[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Address Book data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed',
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* Can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::emailing[]
=== Email Feature
==== Current Implementation
The email mechanism is facilitated by the `GmailUtil` which resides under the `util` package. The implementation
uses the Gmail API which exists as an imported library.

The utility function is implemented as follows:
[source,java]
----

public GmailUtil() throws IOException {
        this.service = getGmailService();
}

----
Our Util Constructor calls getGmailService which will return a Gmail Object.

[source,java]
----
public static Gmail getGmailService() throws IOException {
        Credential credential = authorize();
        return new Gmail.Builder(httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, credential)
                .setApplicationName(APPLICATION_NAME)
                .build();
}
----
This is what the getGmailService looks like, which on a high level authorizes us through the Gmail API
using our client secret and builds the Gmail object. During the authorize function, we also define our permissions
to include sending emails.

[source,java]
----
    private static final List<String> SCOPES = Arrays.asList(GmailScopes.GMAIL_SEND);

    GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow flow =
                    new GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder(
                            httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, clientSecrets, SCOPES)
                            .setDataStoreFactory(dataStoreFactory)
                            .setAccessType("offline")
                            .build();
----

Now that we have the Gmail object, we define a class method that uses the Gmail object to send out an email
[source,java]
----
public static void send(Gmail service, String recipientEmail, String ccEmail, String fromEmail, String title,
                            String message) throws IOException, MessagingException {
        Message m = createMessageWithEmail(createEmail(recipientEmail, ccEmail, fromEmail, title, message));
        service.users().messages().send("me", m).execute();
    }
----

Which of course includes troublesome things like creating MimeMessages
[source,java]
----
private static MimeMessage createEmail(String to, String cc, String from, String subject, String bodyText)
            throws MessagingException {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);

        MimeMessage email = new MimeMessage(session);
        InternetAddress tAddress = new InternetAddress(to);
        InternetAddress cAddress = cc.isEmpty() ? null : new InternetAddress(cc);
        InternetAddress fAddress = new InternetAddress(from);

        email.setFrom(fAddress);
        if (cAddress != null) {
            email.addRecipient(javax.mail.Message.RecipientType.CC, cAddress);
        }
        email.addRecipient(javax.mail.Message.RecipientType.TO, tAddress);
        email.setSubject(subject);
        email.setText(bodyText);
        return email;
    }
----
And generating a Base64 encoded message to use as a raw input to the Message object before it can be consumed by the
gmail service.

[source,java]
----
private static Message createMessageWithEmail(MimeMessage email) throws MessagingException, IOException {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        email.writeTo(baos);
        String encodedEmail = Base64.encodeBase64URLSafeString(baos.toByteArray());
        Message message = new Message();
        message.setRaw(encodedEmail);
        return message;
    }

    Message m = createMessageWithEmail(createEmail(recipientEmail, ccEmail, fromEmail, title, message));
            service.users().messages().send("me", m).execute();
----
// end::emailing[]

//tag::templating[]
=== Template Feature

==== Template Model
===== Current Implementation
The `Template` model is created to support the Emailing feature of the address book. It stores the templates of emails
defined by the user.

Similar to the `Person` model, the `Template` model consists of an `Template` class which includes three String attributes. The attributes include:

i) `Purpose` => the purpose of this email template
ii) `Subject` => the subject of this email template
iii) `Message` => the message of this email template

The `Templates` are stored in a `UniqueTemplateList` in the `AddressBook`. The existing `Model` interface is extended
with functionality to manage the filtered list of `Template`.

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Model Manager for Appointment
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implementing the attributes of `Template` using Strings
** Pros: No need to create three new models just to hold a String, minimized code
** Cons: The attributes are not extensible, eg. you cannot make `Subject` dynamic for an email template
* **Alternative 2:** Create models for every attribute in Template
** Pros: Potential Extension to the models, eg. `Message` can be dynamically change to email address
** Cons: Not much usage for now. Extra layer of complexity for no visible enhancement to user.

==== Add Template Function
===== Current Implementation
The add Template function is implemented as the `AddTemplateCommand` together
with its associated `AddTemplateCommandParser` class. This function supports the adding of an `Template` to the address book.
The implementation of the `AddTemplateCommand` is similar to that of the `AddCommand`.

To enhance the logic of this function, checks are implemented to ensure that no two templates can have the same `Purpose`

Following is a sequence diagram describing how the add Template function works:

image::AddTemplateSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

==== Delete Template Function
===== Current Implementation
The delete Template function is implemented as the `DeleteTemplateCommand` together
with its associated `DeleteTemplateCommandParser` class. This function supports the deletion of an `Template` from the address book. The
implementation of the `DeleteTemplateCommand` is similar to that of the `DeleteCommand`.

Following is a sequence diagram describing how the delete appointment function works:

image::DeleteTemplateSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]
//end::templating[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::deletebefore[]
=== Delete Dated Persons Function
==== Current Implementation
The delete dated persons mechanism supports deleting all persons added before a date who possess all the tags specified by the user.
This function is facilitated by adding a `DateAdded` attribute whenever a `Person` is added to the address book. This
date stamp is added automatically by the application whenever the user adds a new person. Furthermore, to check if a `Person` is to be deleted,
additional predicate classes are implemented.

The command for this function, `DeleteBeforeCommand` inherits from the `UndoableCommand`. This allows user to undo the delete should he/she does it by mistake.
The `DeleteBeforeCommand` takes in `d/DATE` and `[t/TAG...]` as parameters. The `TAG` s parameter allows the user to delete only persons with the
specified tags and not everyone added before a certain date. This enhances the flexibility of this delete function.

The implementation of this function adheres closely to the Object Oriented Principle as well as the Single Responsibility Principle.

Following is a sequence diagram describing how the delete dated persons function works:

image::DeleteBeforeSequenceDiagram.png[width="900", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteBeforeCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Follows the general design of the `delete` command
** Pros: Consistencies in the implementation of commands and command parsers
** Cons: Requires additional methods for removing persons in the `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonList` classes
* **Alternative 2:** Extends the `delete` command
** Pros: Does not require "exploratory" modifications in the `Model` component
** Cons: Needs to call the `delete` command multiple times to delete all targeted persons

===== Aspect: Implementation of `DateAdded`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `DateAdded` as an attribute of a `Person`
** Pros: Consistencies in implementation of the `Person` model that is in line with the OOP and Single Responsibility Principle
** Cons: Requires additional tests and overheads in maintaining an extra attribute
* **Alternative 2:** Include the `DateAdded` directly inside the `Person` class
** Pros: Less overhead needed to maintain the `DateAdded` attribute
** Cons: Reduces consistencies in the existing architecture and reduces coherence of the `Person` class

===== Aspect: Who adds the `DateAdded` attribute?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The application automatically creates a `DateAdded` attribute for every `Person` added
** Pros: Avoids unnecessary errors in user-input date
** Cons: Additional stubs are needed to carry out tests in order to manually fix and manipulate `DateAdded`
* **Alternative 2:** Let the user input the current date
** Pros: The user might input the wrong date or date with invalid format
** Cons: Ease of implementation
// end::deletebefore[]

// tag::scheduling[]
=== Scheduling and Calendar Module
This entire section is dedicated to explaining the whole appointment scheduling and calendar module in view of its scale and significance.

In general, the implementation of this module follows closely the current architecture of the system as shown in <<Design-Architecture, Section 2.1>>.
This is to ensure consistency in the design of the system to keep it simple as _simplicity is consistency_.

A number of Software Engineering Principles are used in the implementation of this module, namely *OOP*, *SOLID*, *YAGNI*, *DRY* principles.
Besides, the commands related to this module are also implemented using the *Command Design Pattern*.

==== Appointment Model
===== Current Implementation
The `Appointment` model is created to support the scheduling feature of the address book. It stores the information of appointments
arranged by the user. The class diagram for the `Appointment` model is as follows:

image::AppointmentClassDiagram.png[width="400", align="center"]

Similar to the `Person` model, the `Appointment` model consists of an `Appointment` class which has its attributes implemented as separate classes to
observe the *Single Responsibility Principle*. The attributes include:

i) `PersonName` => the name of the person the user is having appointment with
ii) `Date` => the date of the appointment
iii) `StartTime` => the start time of the appointment
iv) `EndTime` => the end time of the appointment
v) `Location` => the arranged location of the appointment

The `Appointment` s are stored in a `UniqueAppointmentList` in the `AddressBook`. The existing `Model` interface is extended
with functionalities to manage the filtered list of `Appointment` s. This extension is kept as minimised as possible in light of
the *YAGNI* Principle.

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Model Manager for Appointment
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The existing `ModelManager` is extended to handle the filtered list of `Appointment` s
** Pros: This design adheres to the *DRY* Principle as there will not be a duplicated `ModelManager` for the `Appointment` model
with repeated functionalities as the existing one
** Cons: Additional methods added to the `Model` interface might increase coupling for existing classes that are dependent on
the `ModelManager`. For example, modifications made for `Appointment` in the `ModelManager` might now affect other commands unrelated
to `Appointment` which call the `ModelManager`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create another `Model` interface implemented by another `ModelManager`
** Pros: Ease of implementation and minimal impact on classes coupled with the existing `ModelManager`
** Cons: Violates the *DRY* Principle and causes redundant codes

====== Aspect: Creation of StartTime and EndTime attributes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `StartTime` and `EndTime` are created as separate classes which extends the `Time` class
** Pros: This implementation adheres to the Polymorphism and Inheritance concepts in OOP. Both `StartTime` and `EndTime` has a
_is a_ relationship with `Time`. The separation of `StartTime` and `EndTime` into two classes also support possible future extensions to
these attribute classes. For example, it is now possible to set different limits to `StartTime` and `EndTime` with this implementation.
** Cons: The `StartTime` and `EndTime` have to adhere to the *Liskov Substitution Principle* which means that they cannot be
more restrictive than the parent `Time` class.
* **Alternative 2:** Create `StartTime` and `EndTime` as separate unrelated classes
** Pros: Avoids coupling between `StartTime` and `EndTime` due to an additional `Time` superclass
** Cons: Violates the *DRY* Principle as `StartTime` and `EndTime` share some functionalities, such as the checking of the validity
of an input date

==== Calendar UI
===== Current Implementation
The calendar is implemented using third party libraries provided by https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX].
The calendar panel view is shown below:

image::CalendarView.png[width="650", align="center"]

The setting up of the `CalendarView` is done by first creating a `Calendar` named _Appointments_ which is added to a `CalendarSource`.
The `CalendarSource` is then added to the `CalendarView`. The implementation details are as shown in the following code snippet:
[source,java]
----
CalendarView calendarView;
Calendar calendar;

calendar = new Calendar("Appointments");
CalendarSource calendarSource = new CalendarSource("My Calendar");
calendarSource.getCalendars().addAll(calendar);

calendarView.getCalendarSources().addAll(calendarSource);
----

The `Appointment` s stored in the address book is loaded as `Entries` into the `Calendar` upon start up. The list of `Appointment` s
is passed into the `CalendarPanel` class. For each of these `Appointment` s, its attributes are used to create an `Entry`, which is then
added to the `Calendar`.

When there are changes to the filtered list of `Appointment` s due to addition or deletion of appointments, the `Calendar` is updated
using *Event Handlers*. The event handling for the addition of a new `Appointment` is shown below:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleNewAppointmentAddedEvent(NewAppointmentAddedEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    loadEntry(event.getAppointmentAdded());
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Updating of Calendar due to addition or deletion of appointments
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of event handling to update the `Calendar`
** Pros: Event handling is suitable for UI purposes due to its flexibility
** Cons: The flow of program is less logical and obvious
* **Alternative 2:** The `DeleteAppointmentCommand` and `AddAppointmentCommand` call the `UIManager` to invoke the update to the calendar
** Pros: Associations between the `Logic` and `UI` components are clearer
** Cons: This will introduce a two way dependency between the `Logic` and `UI` components which may lead to confusion and
make the `Logic` component coupled to the `UI` component

====== Aspect: Creation of Calendar
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use third party libraries
** Pros: Readily available hence time saving
** Cons: There might be possible bugs in the libraries provided by third parties

[NOTE]
There is an existing bug in the `YearPage` for the `Calendar`, which causes the `YearPage` to fail to scale its size according
to the size of the `Pane` container

* **Alternative 2:** Create our own `CalendarView`
** Pros: More flexibility with the design of the `CalendarView`
** Cons: Time consuming and manpower intensive

==== Add Appointment Function
===== Current Implementation
The add `Appointment` function is implemented as the `AddAppointmentCommand` together
with its associated `AddAppointmentCommandParser` class. This function supports the adding of an `Appointment` to the address book.
The `AddAppointmentCommand` inherits from the `UndoableCommand` to allow user to undo the addition of an `Appointment`. The
implementation of the `AddAppointmentCommand` is similar to that of the `AddCommand`.

To enhance the logic of this function, checks are implemented to ensure that the `StartTime` of an appointment precedes the `EndTime`.
Besides, the function also disallows the creation of clashing appointments in time.

Following is an activity diagram describing the flow of the add `Appointment` function:

image::aaActivityDiagram.jpg[width="900", align="center"]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: What `Event` to raise when adding a new `Appointment`?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Raise a specially created `NewAppointmentAddedEvent`
** Pros: Do not have to respond to unrelated or unnecessary events
** Cons: Overhead in maintaining the new `Event` class
* **Alternative 2:** Raise the existing `AddressBookChangedEvent`
** Pros: Do not have to implement a new `Event` class
** Cons: The `Calendar` will refresh whenever `AddressBookChangedEvent` is raised, including when only the `Person` list is changed

==== Delete Appointment Function
===== Current Implementation
The delete `Appointment` function is implemented as the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` together
with its associated `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` class. This function supports the deletion of an `Appointment` from the address book.
The `DeleteAppointmentCommand` inherits from the `UndoableCommand` to allow user to undo the deletion of an `Appointment`. The
implementation of the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` is similar to that of the `DeleteCommand`.

Following is a sequence diagram describing how the delete `Appointment` function works:

image::DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[width="900", align="center"]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: What fields to input when deleting an `Appointment`?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use all attributes of an `Appointment` as input fields to delete a matching `Appointment`
** Pros: Certainty in deleting an `Appointment`
** Cons: User has to input all fields which may be cumbersome
* **Alternative 2:** Only input the `PersonName` and `Date` of the `Appointment` to be deleted
** Pros: User does not have to input all the attributes of an `Appointment`
** Cons: There may be more than one `Appointments` with the same `PersonName` and `Date`, which may cause unexpected behaviour by
the `DeleteAppointmentCommand`

==== Calendar Zooming Function
===== Current Implementation
The calendar zooming function is implemented by the `ZoomInCommand` and `ZoomOutCommand`. These `Command` classes are responsible
for raising the `ZoomInEvent` and `ZoomOutEvent`. In turn, `ZoomInEvent` and `ZoomOutEvent` are created to support this function.

If a user tries to zoom in or out when the zoom level is at its maximum, an error message will be shown. To facilitate this,
the `CalendarPanel` contains logic that will raise the `MaxZoomInEvent` or `MaxZoomOutEvent` for such situations. `ZoomInCommand`
and `ZoomOutCommand` will then handle these events raised by throwing a `CommandException` containing the error message.

The actual implementation of the `ZoomInCommand` is as follows:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    raise(new ZoomInEvent());
    while (!receivedFeedback);

    if (isSuccessful) {
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    } else {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_MAX_ZOOM_IN);
    }
}

@Subscribe
private void handleMaxZoomInEvent(MaxZoomInEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    receivedFeedback = true;
    isSuccessful = false;
}

@Subscribe
private void handleZoomSuccessEvent(ZoomSuccessEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    receivedFeedback = true;
    isSuccessful = true;
}
----

The implementation for `ZoomOutCommand` is highly similar to that of the `ZoomInCommand`.

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Where should the event raising be implemented for the `ZoomInCommand` and `ZoomOutCommand`?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement event raising in the `Command` superclass
** Pros: Adheres to the *DRY* principle as `ZoomInCommand` and `ZoomOutCommand` do not have to implement a duplicated event
raising functionality
** Cons: All other command subclasses inherits the unnecessary event raising function
* **Alternative 2:** Implement event raising in a specially created subclass of `Command`, which is in turn inherited by the `ZoomInCommand` and `ZoomOutCommand`
** Pros: Commands that do not need to raise event do not inherit the event raising function
** Cons: Might over-complicate things for these simple commands.

=== Import Contacts from CSV file Function

==== Current Implementation
The Import Contacts mechanism allows users to import contacts from a .csv file. The file should contain the headers _Name_, _Email_, _Phone_, and _Address_ with a separate contact in each row. This functionality is implemented in with classes `ImportContactsCommand` and `ImportContactsCommandParser`. Functionality is tested in `ImportContactsCommandTest`.

The core functionality of the mechanism is in the `executeUndoableCommand()` function of the `ImportContactsCommand` class.

The `ImportContactsCommand` borrows code from _https://github.com/callicoder/java-read-write-csv-file_ for reading the CSV file

The architecture of the mechanism is specified in the below diagram:

image::ImportContactDiagram.png[width="700"]


==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ImportContactsCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ImportContactsCommand`   extends `UndoableCommand` class and calls `model.addPerson`.

* **Alternative 2:** Instead of extending `UndoableCommand` it would be possible to extend `AddCommand` class, and overwrite it to add a while loop to loop over the contacts imported from the CSV and add them to the model

* **Alternative 3:** Instead of extending `UndoableCommand` it would be possible to extend the base class `Command`. Although this solution may be simpler at face value, it would limit the scope of `ImportContactsCommand` and may in fact not be much simpler to impliment.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ImportContactsCommandParser`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parses the argument and creates a new `ImportContactsCommand` passing it a file path if there is any

* **Alternative 2:** Because we know there can only be 1 valid argument, we could check for validity and correctness in the `ImportContactsCommand` class and not implement a parser. This could simplify the overall architecture, but it would increase coupling and decrease cohesion, which is against modern software design principles.
//end::import[]

//tag::export[]
=== Export Contacts to CSV file Function
==== Current Implementation
The exporting persons mechanism allows the user to write the current `Person` list from the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` to a .csv file. The core functionality of this mechanism is contained in the `ExportContactsCommand` class, with a parser written in `ExportContactsCommandParser`.

If the user does not specify a file path, `ExportContactsCommand` will be default write to _data/exportToExisting.csv_. If the user specifies a path to a file that doesn't exist, `CSVPrinter` will create the .csv file and write to it.

`ExportContactsCommand` borrows code from _https://github.com/callicoder/java-read-write-csv-file_ for creating and writing to a .csv file

A diagram of the architecture is displayed below:

image::ExportContactDiagram.png[width="700"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ImportContactsCommand.getCsvToWriteTo()`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Put the logic for `getCsvToWriteTo()` in a separate function that creates and returns a local `CSVPrinter` object.

* **Alternative 2:** An alternative would be to make the `CSVPrinter` object global, instead of returning a local one. This may be slightly more efficient, but it creates inherent risk in that the global variable ma ybe unintentionally modified by another class before writing. Therefore it makes sense to pass it as a local variable.

* **Alternative 3:** Another option would be to simply combin the functionality of `getCsvToWriteTo()` with `executeUndoableCommand()` because they are naturally called together. Although `executeUndoableCommand()` depends on `getCsvToWriteTo()`, the reverse dependency does not hold so in order to increase coupling and decrease cohesion it's better to create a separate function for `getCsvToWriteTo()`.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ExportContactsCommandParser`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `ExportContactsCommandParser.parse(String args)` function uses the condition `if(args.length() < 1)` to check whether the String, `args` is _null_.

* **Alternative 2:** An alternative would be to simply check `if(args == null)` the problem with this approach is that it does not function correctly. The the user inputs `ec`, args is not returned as null, nor is it returned as an empty string. Instead it's returned as a _non-null string_ with `agrs.length() = 0`. Therefore the best way to check whether the user entered a file path is simply check the length of the String *args*.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

[NOTE]
Currently, there is a glitch in the scaling of the calendar Year Page due to bugs in the third party libraries used.

[TIP]
After each test, you can use the `undo` command to restore the initial state of the address book for subsequent tests.

=== Importing Contacts

Importing contacts must be done with a .csv file with similar syntax command as exporting contacts.

It is important to note the Name, Email, Address, and Phone number need to be in the correct order in the .csv file for the contacts to be imported correctly.

More information is given in the  User Guide.

=== Exporting Contacts

For manual testing type `ec` or `export_contacts` followed by the absolute path of a .csv file you would like to export to. It is important to note a couple things:

[NOTE]
* The file must be a .csv file
** Therefore, the file path should end in ".csv". Make sure to include the file ending at the end of the file.
*** For example if you are using a Mac and the file is a .csv file on your Desktop named "test", you could type `~/Users/[username]/Desktop/test.csv` to export the contacts. If the file doesn't exist, it will be automatically created.

What you should see is the excel file (even if it didn't exist before) with the Name, Address, Phone, and Email of the contacts in the address book.

=== Sorting

This function can simply be tested by typing `sort` and/or `so` in the CLI.
