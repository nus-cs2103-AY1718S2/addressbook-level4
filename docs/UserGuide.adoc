== Introduction

CarviciM (Car Servicing Manager) is a desktop application for *managing car servicing jobs*. You can use Carvicim to add jobs, close ongoing jobs, import large number of job entries, manage employees for job assignment and notify employees of jobs through email. CarviciM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CarviciM can get your management of servicing jobs done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== About This User Guide
