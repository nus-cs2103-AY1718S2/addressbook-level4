== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to review employees.*

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will be able to review an employee and hence can track and analyse the performance of an employee.

* *Minor enhancement*: enhanced *find command to be able to search by multiple fields and criteria.* +
** What it does: Before the enhancement, find command can only search by name using a single keyword. The enhancement allows find command to find by multiple fields such as name, tags, and rating using keyphrase. Find command is also enhanced to be able to find using multiple criteria.
