== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the feature of locating a person on Google Map
** What it does: allows the user to locate a person using any fields of a person (e.g, name/phone/email...) on Google Map, and it perfectly helps the user to keep track of the person.
** Justification: Allowing the target users of this app - loan shark managers, to know where their customers are is very important because it's both cost-efficient and time-efficient to assign the customers to the nearest runners if the managers can see the location of the customers on a map.
** Highlights: This enhancement includes the use Google Map which allows for much more future possibilities to integrate with Google. It makes integrating with other Google functions in the future easier.
** Credits: Google Maps URLs
