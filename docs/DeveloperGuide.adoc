== Introduction

Your TA is an address book application designed to amplify the capabilities of a university teaching assistant or tutor.
It aims to provide all the essential functions needed to manage the administrative duties of handling a class as well as
to aid the tutor to better connect with the class. It includes a calendar, scheduling capabilities, as well as the ability to mark
attendance and participation.

== How to contribute to Your TA?

=== New developers

You may wish to refer to Section 3: <<Setting up, Setting up>>
to properly set up the Your TA project file.

Read through the rest of the guide to familiarise yourself with how Your TA components functions together.

Try making some enhancements or edits to a component and make a pull request (PR) to our repo! We will take a look at your PR and
give you some feedback or even merge your code if it's great.

=== Experienced developers

The developer guide contains the design of the models that make up the program. Each section also details how each and every functionality
is implemented and how it interacts with the different components. We would greatly appreciate your help in fine-tuning the components and also
welcome any suggestions or feedback to improve Your TA.

== Setting Up

This section contains the steps needed to properly set up the required files to work on the program source code and to ensure the application runs properly.

=== Prerequisites

The following are essential programs and libraries needed to start developing Your TA.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

. Sufficient *Java* and *Javafx* knowledge
+
[NOTE]
This application is written in Java and Javafx. A good amount of experience with the language (about 10k lines of code written in *Java* and *Javafx*) is required to understand and work in the application.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

Please follow the steps below to download and set up the project.

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Run the following steps to ensure that you successfully set up the project.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

You should see in the console that all the tests have been successfully completed.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

The following configurations should be set up before you start coding to ensure a uniform coding style.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards].
IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B1/main` repository. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B1/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you may:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section will go through the design aspect of Your TA. It contains the architecture of the application and how the components that make up the program function and interact with one another in more detail.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

Figure 1 below is the architecture diagram explains the high-level design of the application. It shows all of the components of the application and how they interact with one another.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence at the app launch, and connects them up with each other.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary when the application exits.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
The classes can be found in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the app's log file.

The rest of the App consists of the following five components:

* <<Design-Login, *`Login`*>>: Authenticates access to app.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the app.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the app in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Do note that each of the last four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 2 given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

Your TA's design is based on an event driven architecture. This allows the different components to communicate with another by utilizing events.

The _Sequence Diagram_ (Figure 3) below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when Your TA data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Login]]
=== Login Component
.Interactions for Login Component
image::Login.png[width="800"]

Upon launching the app, the Login component takes in two inputs from the user: `Username` and `Password`, creates an account, then stores the user's login credentials into a `.xml` file. +
If that `.xml` file already exists (`Username` entered is existing `Username`), it authenticates the User then loads in data previously saved by that User. +
[Optional] `.xml` file is encrypted.

* The login credentials are therefore immutable (cannot be changed).
* The same username and password have to be used every time the user wishes to access the app.
[NOTE]
`Username` and `Password` are case-sensitive.
* Only upon successful authentication will the app load data from the `Storage` Component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component handles to interaction between Your TA and the user. It itself contains other smaller components that build up to form the entire UI.

The figure below shows what makes up the structure of the UI component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As seen in Figure 6, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TodoListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarView` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component loads the layout of each part from the `.fxml` file and then does the bindings to various variables in the address book model in the corresponding `.java` file.

[NOTE]
It may be difficult to edit the `.fxml` file directly. *Javafx* http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/[Scene Builder] is recommended to be used to edit or create new `.fxml` files.

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The logic component controls how Your TA functions upon the different commands that it supports.

Figure 7 below shows how the `LogicManager` functions in the application.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Figure 8 below shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>.

[[fig-LogicCommandClassDiagram]]
.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The following steps are a brief overview of how a command is handled by the logic component.

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in the creation of a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
.  The `UI` then displays to the user the changes and the result of the command.

Figure 9 below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The model component tackles how Your TA maintains the data it holds and how the data is communicated between each major component.

Figure 10 shows the different components and interfaces that make up the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the data used by Your TA.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other four major components.

The following are details of the purpose and function of the different classes that make up the entire `Model`.

The `Person` Class:

* Stores the information of a specific person (student) in Your TA.
* Information includes: Name, Matriculation Number, Phone Number, Email, Address, DisplayPic, Participation and different tags to associate with that person.
* Implements `UniquePersonList` that enforces uniqueness of its elements and disallows nulls.
* `Name`: Object that stores the name of the `Person` object.
[NOTE]
Person's name should only contain alphanumeric characters, and should not be null.
* `Matriculation Number`: Object that stores the matriculation number of the `Person` object.
[NOTE]
Matriculation number should start with either 'A' or 'U', followed by 7 digits and ending with an alphabet (A-Z).
* `Phone Number`: Object that stores the phone number of the `Person` object.
* `Email`: Object that stores the email address of the `Person` object.
[NOTE]
Email address should be of the format _local-part@domain_.
* `DisplayPic`: Object that contains the filepath to the display picture used by the `Person` object.
* `Participation`: Object that stores the participation marks of the `Person` object.

The `User` Class:

* Stores the information of a specific user (TA/Lecturer/Professor) in the application.
* Information includes: Username and Password.
* Implements `UniqueUserList` that enforces uniqueness of its elements and disallows nulls.
* `Username`: Object that stores the username of the `User` Object and contains the regex requirements for a valid username.
[NOTE]
User's username should only contain alphanumeric characters, be between 3 and 15 characters long and should not be null.
* `Password`: Object that stores the password of the `User` Object and contains the regex requirements for a valid password.
[NOTE]
User's password should only contain alphanumeric characters, be between 8 and 30 characters long and should not be null.

The `Tag` Class:

* An immutable object that has to be valid.
* Checks are implemented to guarantee validity.
[TIP]
For every `Person` object, there can be multiple (or zero) tags.

The `Task` Class:

* Stores the information of a specific Task in Your TA.
* Information includes: Title, Description, Deadline, Priority.
* Implements `UniqueTaskList` that enforces uniqueness of its elements and disallows nulls.
* `Title` & `TaskDescription`: Object that stores the title and description of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Tasks title and description should only contain alphanumeric characters, and should not be null.
* `Deadline`: Object that stores the deadline of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Deadline should be a valid date that exists and in the format dd-mm-yyyy. Tasks cannot be scheduled in the past. And can only be scheduled at most 6 months in advance. (Based on months: tasks cannot be scheduled on 1st August 2018 if the current date is 31st January 2018).
* `Priority`: Object that stores the priority of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Priority value input can only be a value from 1 to 3. 1 being lowest priority and 3 being highest.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The storage component maintains the reading and writing of data used by Your TA. It allows the application to save and read files on the user's computer.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save data used by Your TA in xml format and read it back.
* can save images used by Your TA.
* can save the user data in xml format and read it back.
* can save list of `User` objects for login authentication.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::login[]
=== Login feature
==== Current implementation

The login feature is initialized upon startup of the application, through `LoginStorage` and `LoginManager` and is facilitated by the `LoginUi`. +
It supports multiple accounts whereby one user cannot access the application content of another user by creating multiple `.xml` storage files. +

image::LoginDiagram.png[width="800"]

As seen from the diagram, upon opening the application, the user is prompted to enter their `Username` and `Password`. The `LoginManager` fetches the data of existing `User` objects, before putting them into a Hashmap<Username, User> as shown below. +

[source,java]
----
    public synchronized void addUser(String username, String password) throws DuplicateUserException {
        if (!userList.getUserList().containsKey(username)) {
            Username addUsername = new Username(username);
            Password addPassword = new Password(password);
            User toAdd = new User(addUsername, addPassword);
            userList.add(toAdd);
        }
    }
----
[NOTE]
`Username` and `Password` are case-sensitive.

The credentials entered by the user are then checked against the HashMap to authenticate the account. Upon successful login, the user's file is retrieved from the `Storage` component and is loaded up with the application. +

[source, java]
----
@Override
    public void authenticate(String username, String password) throws DuplicateUserException {

        logger.fine("Authenticating user: " + username);
        String filepath = username + ".xml";
        if (userList.getUserList().containsKey(username)) {
            if (userList.getUserList().get(username).getPassword().getPassword().equals(password)) {
                loginUser(filepath);
            } else {
                throw new DuplicateUserException();
            }
        } else {
            addUser(username, password);
            try {
                File file = new File("data/login/" + filepath);
                file.createNewFile();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new DuplicateUserException();
            }
            loginUser(filepath);
        }

    }
----

[NOTE]
If the user is a new (username does not exist), they should simply enter their desired `Username` and `Password` into the respective fields, and the account will be created with the default data of the application.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementing new `User`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Using same login window, create new `User` if `Username` entered does not exist
** Pros: Use of only 1 window, no need to implement additional UI functionalities.
** Cons: Not the most user-friendly or the most conventional way a login works.
* **Alternative 2**: Create a registration button, which brings the user to a registration UI for the creation of `User` object
** Pros: More user-friendly, able to implement a username field, along with a password field and, especially a field for password confirmation.
** Cons: Need to further add onto UI.

===== Aspect: `User` identification
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `Username` is case-sensitive
** Pros: "Johndoe" and "johndoe" are different usernames and different accounts with the same name can be created.
** Cons: If a user makes a typo in the `Username` field, another account is created instead of correctly logging on to their account.
* **Alternative 2**: `Username` to be made case-insensitive
** Pros: Users will not have to worry about whether they signed up with a different `Username`.
** Cons: Less usernames are available.

===== Aspect: `Username` and `Password` Representation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `Username` and `Password` only allow alphanumeric characters
** Pros: Easy authentication, no need to worry about corner cases.
** Cons: Less room for different usernames and passwords, not as secure.
* **Alternative 2**: Include special characters in `Username` and `Password` Regex
** Pros: More secure, less prone to security issues.
** Cons: Need for more rigorous testing to ensure no corner cases are left out.

===== Aspect: Salting Passwords/Encryption of Files
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: No encryption/salting implemented
** Pros: Ease of editing information by administrator.
** Cons: Security issues, easy to find data path and retrieve files.
* **Alternative 2**: Encrypt files and salt passwords before encryption
** Pros: Increases security of software, less prone to be used for malicious purposes.
** Cons: Large amount of coding and implementation required, prerequisites also include knowledge of security issues and safeguards.
// end::login[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`.
It would then proceed to restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::matricuationNumber[]
=== Matriculation number

This feature allows the user to keep track of the matriculation number of a `Person`. The matriculation number in this case
has to start with an "A" or "U" followed by 7 digits and end with a capital letter. A new class, `Matriculation Number`, is created and is associated to the `Person` class.
This is integrated into the `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` commands to update the participation marks of a `Person`.

==== Current implementation

The user will input an AddCommand or EditCommand, with the additional parameter `m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, to the application to update the marks.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Should 2 people be allowed to have to same matriculation number

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** No, no 2 people can have the same matriculation number, DuplicateUserException will be thrown when trying to add a person with a matriculation number already inside Your TA.
** Pros: It makes sense as no 2 students would have the same matriculation number, it alerts the user when they've most likely typed in the wrong matriculation number.
** Cons: The user will not be able to add 2 different instances of the same student.
* **Alternative 2:** Duplicate matriculation numbers are allowed
** Pros: User have more freedom to add anyone.
** Cons: Duplicate matriculation numbers will cause messiness when dealing with many students.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

** Link matriculation number to the students IVLE account info.
// end::matriculationNumber[]

// tag::participation[]
=== Participation

This feature allows the user to keep track of participation marks of a `Person`. The participation marks in this case is limited to an integer value of 0 to 100 inclusive. A new class, `Participation`, is created and is associated to the `Person` class.
This utilizes the `MarkCommand` command to update the participation marks of a `Person`.

==== Current implementation

The user will input a command, `markPart INDEX marks/DIGITS`, to the application to update the marks.

The following figure 12 and paragraph below shows the sequence of how the `MarkCommand` command functions:

.MarkCommand Sequence Diagram
image::MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]


. The user will enter the command `markPart INDEX marks/DIGITS` to the application.
. The application will then pass the arguments to `AddressBookParser` which in turns passes it to  `MarkCommandParser` to parse the argument.
. The `MarkCommandParser` would then create a `MarkCommand` with the data from the arguments.
. The `LogicManager` will then execute the `preprocessUndoableCommand()` in `MarkCommand`.
. The `preprocessUndoableCommand()` will then execute the `createUpdatedPerson()` to create a new `Person` object with a new `Participation` object containing the new total marks.
. Finally, this new `Person` object created in step 3 will replace the original `Person` object with the old `Participation` object stored in the `Model` through the `updatePerson()` method.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to update the marks

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create an entire new `Person` object
** Pros: It is similar to the rest of the `Logic` commands.
** Cons: This uses more memory when executing.
* **Alternative 2:** Make the `value` in the `Participation` class editable
** Pros: It uses less memory, and only the value has to be updated.
** Cons: The implementation will require the writing of more methods.

===== Aspect: Setting a limit to the number of marks

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set the limit of participation marks to 100
** Pros: Maintain a fixed value, prevents unforeseen issues such as <<integer-overflow,integer overflows>>.
** Cons: The user is restricted to only 100 marks total, and has to be more careful in the amount of marks they wish to add.
* **Alternative 2:** Do not set a limit for the amount of participation marks
** Pros: It is more flexible, and allows more variation in the marks the user wishes to add
** Cons: This requires more validation checks to prevent issues like an integer overflow.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

** Support for setting a threshold and easily seeing how many students made the cut over the threshold.

// end::participation[]

// tag::display[]

=== Display picture

Users are able to add a display picture for any person within the application. The user can utilise 3 different commands (`add`, `edit` and `updateDP`) to create and specify a display image for the person.
It fully supports the `undo` and `redo` commands as well. It adds a drop shadow around the frame to indicate the level of participation (see above section 5.3) of the person.

This feature allows the user to enter a path to their selected image file when entering any of the above 3 commands and copies the image into the `data/displayPic` folder.

It utilises the `DisplayPicStorage` class to handle all image storage related operations.

It also makes use of the `Participation` feature to display a colored shadow around the display picture.
This image will be shown in the application next to the details of the person as seen in figure 13 below.

.Display Picture example
image::displaypic_personcard.PNG[width="250"]

==== Current implementation

An additional class, `DisplayPic`, is added to the `Person` class. This class contains the filepath to the stored image file.
It uses validation checks to ensure that the image meets the following requirements:

** It is a file that exists and has a file extension.
** It is a valid image file that can be opened as an image.

If it passes the checks, then a new `DisplayPic` object will be created with the filepath to the image stored as its value.
It will then proceed to duplicate the image. After duplicating the image, the value will be further updated with the duplicate image's filepath.

===== Adding a display picture when creating a new person

The `add` command supports a new field `dp/`, where the user will provide the filepath of the image and the newly created `Person` will have that specified image as the display picture.

For persons that were not specified a `dp/` during the `add` command, the `DisplayPic` object associated to them would contain the value of the default display picture.

===== Editing a display picture

The display picture can also be changed by using the `edit` or `updateDP` commands.
The implementation of the UpdateDisplayCommand (`updateDP`) command closely follows the `edit` command, hence we will only showcase the implementation of the `UpdateDP` command.

The following figure 14 is the sequence diagram of the `updateDP` command to show how it functions:

.UpdateDisplayCommand Sequence Diagram
image::UpdateDisplayCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user input will be passed in and parsed by the `AddressBookParser` and `UpdateDisplayCommandParser`.
. The `UpdateDisplayCommandParser` then creates a new `UpdateDisplayCommand` where the `LogicManager` executes the `preprocessUndoableCommand()`.
. The `preprocessUndoableCommand()` will execute the `createUpdatedPerson()` to create a new `Person` object with the updated `DisplayPicture` object which contains the new filepath.
. Finally, this new `Person` object created in step 3 will replace the original `Person` object with the old `DisplayPic` object stored in the `Model` through the `updatePerson()` method.

===== Deleting a display picture

To fully support the `undo` and `redo` commands, image files cannot be immediately deleted when it is not in use by the `UI`.

To work around this, a new class `UniqueItemList` was added to the model of the `AddressBook` as seen below in Figure 15.

.AddressBook Class Diagram
image::AddressBookClass.png[width="600"]

The `UniqueItemList` consists of an `ArrayList` of unique `String` objects. These `String` objects represent the filepaths of all images that have been added or are used by the application during its runtime.

Upon every launch of the application, during the initialization of the `LogicManager` class, it will run through the `UniqueItemList` and delete
any unused image files from the `data` folder. It does this by looping through the `UniquePersonList` as well and checks if the image file is used. If it is not used, it will be deleted.
The following code fragment shows the deletion process:

[source, java]
----
public static void clearImageFiles(List<String> itemsToDelete, ObservableList<Person> persons) {
    for (String item : itemsToDelete) {
        boolean notUsed = true;
        for (Person p : persons) {
            if (p.getDisplayPic().toString().equals(item) || item.equals(DisplayPic.DEFAULT_DISPLAY_PIC)) {
                notUsed = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (notUsed) {
            //deletion of file occurs here
        }
    }
}
----

The list is then cleared for the next usage of the application.

===== Storing the image file for the display picture
The application will take in an argument for the 3 commands mentioned above through `dp/ [PATH TO IMAGE]`. The `[PATH TO IMAGE]` can be the absolute or relative path to the image file.
[NOTE]
An example of a `[PATH TO IMAGE]` would be C:\Users\Desktop\Image.jpg for Windows.

If this `[PATH TO IMAGE]` leads to a non-existent file or a non-image file, it will utilise the default profile picture
which is stored in `src/resources/images/displayPic` as `default.png`.
If a valid path to an image is provided, the image will be processed and copied over to the `data` folder where the `addressbook.xml` is stored as well.

The filename of the image copied over will be a <<sha-256,SHA-256>> hash. This hash is calculated over the `Person` object's details (i.e Name, Phone and Email) to ensure a unique filename.
The following activity diagram in Figure 16 shows how the files are saved:

.Activity diagram for storing image files
image::StoreDisplayPictureActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Due to the possibility that display pictures for a `Person` can be updated, this could lead to clashing of the same file names. In order to prevent overwriting of files, the new image filename
will be the SHA-256 hash of the previous image filename.

The code utilised to duplicate the image file copies the file byte for byte, ensuring that they are binary equivalent. The code used is implemented as follows:
[source, java]
----
public static void copyFile(String origFile, File outputFile) throws IOException {
        //initialize buffer
        //open bis/bos as the buffered input and output streams respectively

        int fileBytes = bis.read(buffer);
        while (fileBytes != -1) {
            bos.write(buffer, 0, fileBytes);
            fileBytes = bis.read(buffer);
        }
        //close IO streams
}
----
Finally, the `DisplayPic` object will then be updated to store the relative filepath to this new duplicated image.

===== Fetching and displaying the image file
The following activity diagram shows the flow of how an image file is retrieved to be displayed.

.Activity diagram for fetching image files
image::FetchDisplayPictureActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The image file will then be utilized by JavaFX and displayed on the UI. The drop shadow of the image is determined by the `Participation` of the `Person`.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Filepath to the image
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy the image file over to a designated location.
** Pros: The user does not need to maintain the image file, as the application does so itself.
** Cons: Duplication of the image file will take up more space on the user's storage.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the location of the file the user enters into the application.
** Pros: This would mean that there would always be only one copy of the image, hence less space used.
** Cons: The user needs to ensure the original image file is not moved or deleted.

===== Aspect: Filename of the image
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a hashing algorithm to name the file.
** Pros: SHA-256 provides <<collision-resistance,collision resistance>> which means the filename would be unique majority of the time and it is easy to implement.
** Cons: It is difficult to manually check which `Person` the image file belongs to.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the name of the `Person` to name the file.
** Pros: Image files can be easily identified separately and easy to implement.
** Cons: This could lead to potential image files overwriting each other without additional checks.

===== Aspect: Deletion of the image
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the filepath in the `AddressBook` and delete it afterwards.
** Pros: Fully supports `undo` and `redo` even if the user moves or deletes the original image file.
** Cons: It is difficult to manually check which `Person` the image file belongs to.
* **Alternative 2:** Delete the image file immediately when the associated `Person` is removed.
** Pros: This allows a simple implementation of immediately deleting the image file.
** Cons: The image file could be lost forever if the user moves or deletes the original image file, thus causing `undo` and `redo` to malfunction.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

* Support for online URLs to download images.

// end::display[]

// tag::task[]
=== Task list

Users are able to add, edit and remove tasks (with command `addTask`, `editTask` and `deleteTask`) in order to schedule their tasks within the application.
Tasks scheduled in this application will be stored in `addressbook.xml` and displayed in the `Todo List` tab and `Calender` view respectively.

`Todo List` displays tasks with all fields (title, description, deadline and priority) in a list view whereas `Calender` displays tasks with only task titles in their respective date cells determined by their deadline.
Tasks displayed in a date cell are color coded according to their priorities -- Green being lowest, yellow being medium and red being highest . Tasks are displayed in `Todo List` and `Calender` as shown in figure 19.

.Tasks displayed in the application.
image::displayTask.png[width = "800"]

==== Current implementation

An additional class, `UniqueTaskList` is added to the `AddressBook` class. This class contains an `ObservableList` of tasks and a 2-dimensional `ObservableList` of tasks.
The previous is the actual copy of tasks stored in `addressbook.xml` while the latter is a copy of reorganized tasks for displaying in `Calendar`.

===== Adding a task

The `addTask` command requires fields of `title/`, `desc/`, `by/` and `priority/` to be present.
Any missing field will cause a built-in exception thrown when creating the `Task` object as the `addTaskCommandParser` validates the presence of all required fields.
The exception prevents the invalid task from being created and added into `UniqueTaskList`.

Multiple of same field is allowed but all are discarded except the last entry of that field by `ArgumentTokenizer` called in `AddTaskCommandParser`.

After successful creating the `Task` object, `ModelManager` will help add the object into `Addressbook`.

===== Deleting a task

The `deleteTask` command requires a positive task index which specifies the task to be deleted. The `DeleteTaskCommandParse` validates this index with accordance to the current displayed `Todo List` size.
If the index is valid, the `DeleteTaskCommand` will delete the corresponding `Task` object from `UniqueTaskList`.

===== Editing a task

The `editTask` command requires a positive task index and desired edit fields indicated by prefix `title/`, `desc/`, `by/` and `priority/`. The `EditTaskCommandParser` validates that there is at least one field specified in the command.

`EditTaskCommand` then creates a new `Task` object with modified fields and other unmodified fields identical.
The `AddressBook` will be called by `ModelManager` to delete the original `Task` object from the `UniqueTaskList` and add the newly created task to the `UniqueTaskList`.

[NOTE]
====
Add task, delete task and edit task commands support `undo` and `redo` commands.
====

Add task, delete task and edit task commands have similar sequence behavior. Below is an example of the overview how components interact during deletion of a task.

.Dlete a task.
image::DeleteTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width = "800"]

===== Listing tasks

The execution of `listTask` command parses a predicate argument PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASK to `ModelManager` which updates the task list based on this predicate.
This will extract all tasks saved in the data file `addressbook.xml`.

===== Listing current month tasks

The execution of `listCurrentTask` command parses the predicate argument PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_CURRENT_TASK to `Model`. `ModelManager` then updates the task list based on this predicate.
This is similar to Listing tasks but it will only extract tasks with deadlines due in the current month.

===== Sorting tasks

`Task` class implements Java `Comparable<>` class which enables sorting without writing the actual sorting algorithm. Thus,the execution of `sortTask` command relies on it.
`Model` then calls `AddressBook` which sorts the tasks in `UniqueTaskList`.

The sorting is done by comparing the year, month and date sequentially. This is specified in the compareTo() method in `Task`.

[NOTE]
====
listing and sorting tasks do not support `undo` and `redo` commands.
====

==== Design consideration

===== Aspect: How `EditTaskCommand` executes
* **Alternative 1(current choice): ** Adds a new Task and deletes the original task
** Pros: Easy to implement, no need to worry about the change of deadline shown in `Calendar`
** Cons: Unable to maintain the original task list order.

* **Alternative 2: ** Edits the field of original task
** Pros: Maintains the task list order
** Cons: Difficult to implement as a new mechanism to sync the `Calendar` cells is needed.

// end::task[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Tasks on calendar view

** This feature allows the user to see the calendar on the UI and see the scheduled `Task` deadlines on the calendar.

==== Current implementation

The user will enter a command `addTask title/TITLE desc/DESCRIPTION by/DEADLINE priority/PRIORITY` to the application. The application will then rely on `AddressBookparser` and
parse the argument. The argument will be passed into the AddTaskCommand to be executed. From there, it will create a new `Task` object that will be
added to the `calendarList` of the `UniqueTaskList` which in turn will be displayed on the date of the deadline, on the calendar.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to link specific tasks to the correct calendar nodes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a 7 by 32, 2D `Array` to store the tasks to be added into the calendar.
** Pros: Separate from the Task list (less prone to bugs). Faster run time (does not need to iterate through all tasks).
** Cons: Higher memory usage constraint, can only schedule tasks up to 6 months in advance to prevent high memory usage that will affect the speed and performance of the app.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the task list itself to be displayed in the calendar.
** Pros: Easier to program and less memory usage (only 1 task list is used without another 2D array for the calendar), tasks can be scheduled as far ahead as desired.
** Cons: Needs to iterate through the entire task list for every calendar node when loading the calendar view (slows performance when dealing with tasks).

===== Aspect: Viewing the calendar only by month

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a monthly only calendar view.
** Pros: Easy view of the current tasks that are due on that month.
** Cons: Not much choice for the user as only the monthly view is provided.
* **Alternative 2:** Give the user a choice to switch between weekly, monthly or yearly, e.g. _calendarfx_.
** Pros: User has more choice and freedom to control their UI.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, also if 3rd party programs such at _calendarfx_ is used, certain features in those programs are redundant (e.g. map) and would only slow the app down.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

** Link specific key-press or select actions to the todo list such that a click on either side will display the selected task on the other.
//end::calendar[]

=== Logging

We utilize `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class manages the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file. (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g app name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data encryption (coming in v2.0)

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

Use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* To run the tests, You need to open a console or terminal and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
Detailed information on how to run tests using Gradle is specified in <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>>.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit Tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit Tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration Tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of Unit and Integration Tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for Build Automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. +
See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When there are changes to asciidoc files in a pull request, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. +
See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope and Features

=== Product scope

*Target user profile*: Tech-Savvy University Teachers/Tutors

* have the need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing over mouse input
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app, includes to-do
    list features (with prioritization, etc.) and scheduling (with calendar)

=== Feature contribution

*Wu Di*

* *Major*: Implement the todo list

This helps the tutor remember the commands intuitively and type them more efficiently.

*Daniel*

* *Major*: Calendar and Scheduler for user

** Supports adding of new tasks that will be slotted into the calendar(if it has a deadline)
** Also assigns a priority value to each task based on parameters keyed in when task is added

This helps the tutor to keep track of what needs to be done and which task to focus on.

* *Minor*: Person has new parameter - Matriculation number

** Person now stores matriculation number of the person
** Add command supports adding person with matriculation number(compulsory parameter)
** Find command supports search by matriculation number

This helps the tutor to easily search for a certain student by their unique matriculation number instead of just
their names (e.g. easier than searching for a common name such as Daniel).

* *Minor*: Toggle between dark and light theme

** The app can now be toggled between 2 different themes.

This allows the tutor to customise their GUI so that they do not have to be restricted to 1 set layout throughout the entire time they use the app.

*Pearlissa*

* *Major*: Login feature

** Implements new User package

This allows multiple tutors to store their data in separate accounts, which can only be accessed by them.

* *Minor*: Sorting of contacts based on selected parameters

** Any number of parameters (at least 1), and in order of priority

This allows tutors to be better able to go through their lists of students.

*Ellery*

* *Major*: Display picture for all students entered

** Support adding, editing and deleting of picture
** Also shows a quick glance on student's participation (related to minor)
** Also works with the redo/undo function

This helps the tutor keep track of his students, and be able to easily remember them better.

* *Minor*: Participation marks to keep track of student participation

** Add and keep track of participation marks for the student

This helps the tutor to keep track of the student's participation.
