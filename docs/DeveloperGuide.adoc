== Introduction
image:FASTIS.png[width="500"] +
Fastis is a desktop application which functions as an address book that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively. The application enables students to keep track of group membersâ€™ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos, and schedule suitable meetup time.

This Developer Guide is meant to provides the necessary information for developers who are interested in contributing to this application.
New developers should begin with <<SettingUp>>. Experienced developers might want begin instead with the <<Design>> section to learn more about how Fastis is structured.


Understanding the implementation of the features in Fastis will be crucial to be able to modify any feature for further improvements.


[[SettingUp]]
== Setting up
This section provides information on setting up the project in order to work on Fastis.

=== Prerequisites

The following programs have to be installed on the computer system before setting up.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

The following steps should be done to verify that the setup of Fastis is correct:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

The following configurations should be done to ensure that Fastis future development follows good coding standards and practices.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: Ensure that the import order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

You should set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

[[Design]]
== Design

This section describes how Fastis is built and how its different components interact and work with each other.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture_* Diagram given below (<<Figure1>>) explains the high-level design of Fastis. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[[Figure1]]
.Architecture Diagram.
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

The `Main` component has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other during application launch.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary during shut down.

The <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> component represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The <<Design-Database,*`Database`*>> component handles the downloading of module information via the https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/tree/master/api/data[NUSmods API], as well as holding and retrieving the information. Because it is only accessed and never changed, the database component resides on its own outside of the `Model` component.

The rest of the App consists of these components:

<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The holder of the data of the App in-memory.
<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The location on the hard disk where date is read from and written to.

Each of the above four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see <<logicClassDiagram>>) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[[logicClassDiagram]]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

_<<figure3>>_  shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

[[figure3]]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1).
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

<<figure4>> shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

[[figure4]]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2).
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component handles the inputs from and the outputs to the User Interface. It consists of a MainWindow that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. Refer to <<figure5>>.

[[figure5]]
.Structure of the UI Component.
image::UiClassDiagramV1.5.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]


The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The Logic component handles the commands from user and passes the command results to the User Interface.
Refer to <<fig-LogicClassDiagram, Figure 6>> and <<fig7, Figure 7>> for class diagrams on how the `Logic` component is structured.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component.
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
[[fig7]]
.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

Given below is the workflow of the Logic Component when the user inputs a command:

.  The `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

<<fig8, Figure 8>> shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[fig8]]
.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command.
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The model component stores and operates on the data held by Fastis as shown in <<fig9, Figure9>>.
[[fig9]]
.Structure of the Model Component.
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

The model component does not depend on any of the other three components, meaning that it does not rely on any functions outside of itself to operate.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The storage component saves processed data from Fastis on to the running machineâ€™s hard-disk and reads from the stored data as shown in <<fig10, Figure 10>>.
[[fig10]]
.Structure of the Storage Component.
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reading it back on next startup.
* saves the Address Book data in xml format and read it back on next startup.

//tag::Database[]
[[Design-Database]]
=== Database component

The Database component is in charge of connections to the web.

The `Database` component:

* downloads module information from the `NUSmods API`.
* retrieves modules given a NUSmods timetable link.

[NOTE]
NUSmods timetable links are the sharable short URL from a NUSmods page.
E.g. http://modsn.us/MYwiD

The sturucture of the Database component is shown in <<fig11, Figure 11>>
[[fig11]]
.Structure of the Database Component.
image::DatabaseClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

//end::Database[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes that are used by multiple components, such as `BaseEvent` and `JsonUtil`, are defined in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The Undo feature allows users to restore the state before the latest command while the Redo feature reverses the Undo command.

==== Current implementation


The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. <<fig12, Figure 12>> shows the inheritance of commands:
[[fig12]]
.Execution of delete command.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from <<fig12, Figure 12>>, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command). Refer to <<fig13, Figure 13>> for an illustration.

.Push of delete command into undoStack.
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack` (<<fig14, Figure 14>>). For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Execution of Adding David.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed (<<fig15, Figure 15>>).

.State before the add command restored.
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

<<fig16>> shows how the undo operation works:

[[fig16]]
.Sequence diagram for Undo/Redo.
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, pushes to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack` (<<fig17, Figure 17>>). This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).
[[fig17]]
.Execution of clear command.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution (as shown in <<fig18, Figure 18>>):
[[fig18]]
.Execution of list command, which will not be added to undoStack after execution.

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

The following considerations were taken into account during the design of this feature.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation preserves undo/redo functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: This implementation does not involve the template pattern, and is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: This implementation makes it so that classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: This implementation is easy to implement.
** Cons: This implementation may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: This implementation uses less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: This implementation reduces leeway for error and forces developers to ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the `AddressBook`.
** Pros: This implementation only reverts changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: This implementation might confuse users as to whether the command also works when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example).
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: This implementation might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: This implementation makes it harder for users who only want to revert changes to `AddressBook`.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: This implementation is easy to understand for new Computer Science undergraduates to understand, who are likely new developers.
** Cons: This implementation duplicates `Logic`. For example, when a new command is executed, both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`must be update.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: This implementation  just reuses what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: This implementation violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to undo commands on top of keeping track of them.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::ModuleDatabase[]
=== Module database feature

The database feature enables Fastis to store and quickly find lesson schedules.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses the available `NUSmods API` to retrieve module information from the API server.

The sequence diagram (<<fig20, Figure 20>>) for the instantiation of DatabaseManager is shown below.

.Sequence diagram for the instantianion of DatabaseManager.
image::DatabaseComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

On startup, the network component makes a connection to the API server and checks the `lastmodified` field of the `JSON` file on the server. If the `lastmodified` date is more recent that the `JSON` file held in storage, the network component will download and overwrite the existing file on disk.

The `Storage` component then converts the JSON file into a hashMap of modules to be held in the `Database` component.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of Module information

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store a complete dataset of all modules
** Pros: This implementation allows Fastis to access information even when used offline.
** Cons: This implementation requires more memory space.
* **Alternative 2:** Store nothing, retrieve only module information of single module each time.
** Pros: This implementation does not require any storage space.
** Cons: This implementation requires Fastis to constantly download information from the web, making the app reliant on good internet connection.

// end::ModuleDatabase[]

//tag::Calendar[]
=== Calendar feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Calendar` class, adapted from https://github.com/SirGoose3432/javafx-calendar[javafx-calendar] by SirGoose3432.
It is used to view the user's upcoming events, e.g. interviews, meetings, etc.

==== Current implementation

The calendar feature is facilitated by `Calendar` and `CalendarDate` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the calendar
in the application when given a list of `Event` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `CalendarChangedEvent` is raised.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown is <<fig21, Figure 21>> below.
[[fig21]]
.Sequence diagram for CalendarChangedEvent
image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`Calendar` utilizes the `Event` class to determine which slots in the schedule are occupied.
Hence, a list of events is passed to every calendar upon construction and saved as a private variable.

The details of these event, e.g. time, location, are saved locally in `.xml` file format.
It is also retrieved upon start up by the `Storage` component and saved within the `Model` for the whole process.

The implementation of `Calendar` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Calendar(ObservableList<Event> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initCalendar();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initCalendar() {
    // ... Create the calendar 7x6 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 42 CalendarDate objects ...
    fillCalendar(currentYearMonth);
    showEvents();
    // ... show CalendarView ...
}

private void fillCalendar(YearMonth yearMonth) {
    // ... Fill the calendar with the correct dates according to yearMonth ...
}

private void showEvents() {
    // ... Show all events that are in the current yearMonth in the eventList ...
}
----

The current time is retrieved upon startup, and the calendar base on that point in time to display the appropriate time frame.

==== Design Considerations
[[calendarImplementation]]
===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Calendar`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a stand-alone `Calendar` class
** Pros: This implementation makes data manipulation and appearance customizing easy.
** Cons: This implementation might lack functionalities available in external libraries.
* **Alternative 2:** Import external libraries/API
** Choices:
*** https://developers.google.com/calendar/[Google Calendar API]
*** https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX]
** Pros: This implementation would be likely be optimized and have more functionalities.
** Cons: This implementation restricts developers to what the libraries offer, and require a firm understanding of these external APIs.

===== Aspect: Storing of the `eventList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `eventList` within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy to show events and their details, even after the constructor returns.
** Cons: This implementation takes up some memory even if there are no commands for showing these events.
* **Alternative 2:** Only passes the `eventList` as a parameter to the constructor and not storing it as a field within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: This implementation uses less memory and makes code less cluttered.
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard to show events and their details outside of the constructor.
// end::Calendar[]

//tag::Timetable[]
[[Timetable]]
=== Timetable feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Timetable` class, based largely on the `Calendar` class. It is used to view the user's own NUSMods timetable as well as that of other people in his address book.

==== Current implementation

The timetable is the weekly equivalent to the monthly Calendar.
This feature is similarly facilitated by the analogous `Timetable` and `TimetableSlot` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the timetable
in the application when given a list of `WeeklyEvent` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `TimetableChangedEvent` is raised.
This is done either by a precedent `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` or a `ScheduleGroupCommand`.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown <<fig22,Figure 22>> below.
[[fig22]]
.Sequence diagram for TimetableChangedEvent
image::TimetableSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `Timetable` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Timetable(ObservableList<WeeklyEvent> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initTimetable();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initTimetable() {
    // ... Create the calendar 6x11 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 66 TimetableSlot objects ...
    clearTimetable();
    showSlots();
    // ... show TimetableView ...
}

private void clearTimetable() {
    // ... Draw all slots as blank ...
    // ... Draw the timeline on the left ...
}

private void showSlots() {
    // ... Show all slots that are in the in the eventList ...
    // ... Make sure no 2 modules with different name would have the same color ...
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Timetable` and Storing of the `eventList`
As the weekly equivalent of `Calendar`, `Timetable` has the same aspect to consider. See <<calendarImplementation, Implementation of the Calendar>>.

===== Aspect: Supporting modules on weekends and/or after 6pm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Don't support showing those modules
** Pros: This implementation makes the GUI less cluttered and more readable
** Cons: This implementation cannot cater to users with modules outside these times. Users cannot schedule events on weekends.
* **Alternative 2:** Support showing those modules
** Pros: This implementation caters to users with those modules, and support scheduling for the weekends.
** Cons: This implementation makes the GUI look cluttered, as the GUI already has other main components.
// end::Timetable[]

//tag::showingTimetable[]
[[showingTimetable]]
=== Showing the timetable

This feature allows users to see a person's timetable by selecting him/her.

==== Current implementation
When a person is selected, either by the `select` command or by mouse click via the GUI, a `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is raised. The flow of operation thereafter is shown <<fig23, Figure 23>> below.

.Sequence digaram for PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent.
image::nusModsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon receiving the event, the `UI` component takes the `Person` within the `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` and calls the `parseEvents()` method of `DataBaseManager`, passing the `TimetableLink` of the `Person` as an argument.

The result of the `parseEvents()` is an `ArrayList` of `WeeklyEvents`. This result is used to form a `TimeTableChangedEvent`, which ultimately tells the `UI` component to display the result.

The implementation of `parseEvents()` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public static ArrayList<WeeklyEvent> parseEvents(TimeTableLink link) {
        ArrayList<WeeklyEvent> eventList = new ArrayList<>();

        if (!isCurrentSem(link)) {
           // ... display and log warning messages ...
        }

        String query = getQuery(link);

       // ... parse query into WeeklyEvents ...

        return eventList;
    }
----

The `parseEvents()` method firsts checks if the `TimetableLink` points to a schedule that is in the same semester as Fatis' database. It then calls the `getQuery` helper method, which a `URLconnection` to the shortened URL in `TimetableLink` and returns the `query` part of the full-length URL.

The method then takes the `query` and parses them into modules and lessons, which are used to form `WeeklyEvents`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of a person's schedule

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store only the link to a NUSmods page for each person
** Pros: This implementation requires very little space. The schedule of a person can easily be changed by editing the `TimetableLink`.
** Cons: This implementation requires Fastis to make a connection to the web each time a person is selected.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the schedule of each person in the `AddressBook`
** Pros: This implementation will require much more space, and there will be a dilemma between whether to store it as `WeeklyEvent`, or `Module` and `schedule`
** Cons: This implementation requires Fastis to make a connection to the web only when a person is added or edited.

[[Scheduling]]
=== Schedule meetings feature
Fastis supports showing all the common free time slots for all members in based on their timetable.

==== Current implementation
Fastis utilizes a few components to schedule the meetings, namely the `Group` class and `WeeklyEvent` class in `Model`, `Timetable` in `UI`, and `parseEvents()` in `Database`.
The command to show the scheduled meetings is `ScheduleGroupCommand`, which resides in `Logic` component.

When a `ScheduleGroupCommand` is executed, it first gets all group members from `Model`.
For each member, it parses the `TimetableLink` to get all of his/her modules, and add them to an `occupied` list.
From that list, the command generates all free time slots in another list called `free`, and post that event to be handled by the `UI` component later.

The flow of operation is shown in <<fig24, Figure 24>> below.
[[fig24]]
.Sequence diagram for ScheduleGroupCommand().
image::ScheduleGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public ScheduleGroupCommand(Group group) {
    requireNonNull(group);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    EventsCenter.getInstance().registerHandler(this);
}

public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    // ... Get the group's member from Model ...
    fillTimeSlots(group);
    generateFreeTimeSlots();
    // ... Post new TimetableChangedEvent ...
    // ... Return new CommandResult ...
}

private void fillTimeSlots(Group group) {
    for (Person member : group.getPersonList()) {
        // ... Parse the TimetableLink into moduleList
        // ... Add all modules in moduleList to occupied list
    }
}

private void generateFreeTimeSlots() {
    // ... Generate free time slots logic
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Scheduling algorithm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show all free time slots
** Pros: This implementation is intuitive for users, and easy to read.
** Cons: This implementation slow, as there are a few extra steps to process.
* **Alternative 2:** Show all occupied time slots
** Pros: This implementation is very fast.
** Cons: This implementation could make GUI cluttered as there are normally more occupied slots than free slots. Also, it might not be intuitive for users.
// end::Scheduling[]

// tag::listTagMembers[]
=== List Tag Members feature

Fastis lists all persons in Fastis that have tags similar to input.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses `ListTagMembersCommand`, which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
tag. <<fig25, Figure 25>> shows the sequence diagram of the `listTagMembers` command
[[fig25]]
.Sequence diagram of `listTagMembers` command.
image::listTagMemberSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

When user types in command line `listTagMembers` or `lTM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
tag and list out all members with the same  tag.

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command `listTagMembersCommand()` to list out the members with same tag.
** Pros: This implementation makes it is easy to change the methods called by command.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Change existing find command to include finding person with same tags.
** Pros: This implementation can reduce number of commands required to be remembered.
** Cons: This implementation can affect the functionality of existing commands.

// end::listTagMembers[]

// tag::addGroup[]
[[Group]]
=== Add Group feature

Fastis has a group feature that can:

* add a group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a group with information that was stated  by user input.
* add a person into the group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a person from the group with information that was stated by user input.
* list all the members in the group with information that was stated by user input.


==== Current implementation

The group mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueGroupList`, which resides inside `Model` component. Address book stores all groups in `UniqueGroupList`.
The groups in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `Information` object, representing the information of the group.
`Group`,`Information` and `UniqueGroupList` class reside inside `Model` component. <<fig26, Figure 26>>  is the class diagram showing the relationship between `Group`, `Information` and `UniqueGroupList`:

[[fig26]]
.Group Class Diagram.

<<fig27, Figure 27>>  is a object diagram of Group Class.

[[fig27]]
.Object Diagram of `Group`.
image::GroupObjectDiagram.png[width="600"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application . The `UniqueGroupList` in the address book will include few groups that are declared in SampleDataUtil.

A Group consists of the following:

* Information: Represents the information of the group.
* PersonList: Represents the list of persons in a group.

The add group feature adds a group with information named by user in input into Fastis.


The add group mechanism is facilitated by `AddGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding `Group` object to the address book. `AddGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, `AddGroupCommand` can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the `AddGroupCommand` that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

<<fig28, Figure 28>> shows the interaction of `AddGroup` Command class.

[[fig28]]
.Class Diagram of add group Command.
image::AddGroupCommandClassDiagram.png[width:"600"]

The user executes a new `AddGroupCommand` with `Information`, to add a new group to the address book.
The new group is added to the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.

The `AddGroupCommand` is facilitated by `AddGroupCommandParser` to parse `AddGroupCommand`.
<<fig29, Figure 29>>  shows the flow of parsing of `AddGroupCommand` object.

[[fig29]]
.Sequence Diagram for AddGroupParser.

<<fig30, Figure 30>> diagram shows how the add group operation works:

[[fig30]]
.AddGroup Sequence Diagram.
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeAddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation preserves `addGroup` functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `AddGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeAddGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Add Member To Group feature

Fastis adds a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The add member to group mechanism is facilitated by `AddMemberToGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports adding a member to `Group` objects to the address book. `AddMemberToGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddMemberToGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddMemberToGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddMemberToGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage as shown in  the following sequence diagram where  the storage saves to file in XmlAdaptedGroups.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

<<fig31, Figure 31>> shows the interaction of `AddMemberToGroup` Command class.

[[fig31]]
.Class Diagram of AddMemberToGroup Command.
image::aGMCommandClassDiagram.png[width:"600"]

The `AddMemberToGroupCommand` is facilitated by `AddMemberToGroupCommandParser` to parse `AddMemberToGroupCommand`.
<<fig32, Figure 32>> shows the flow of parsing of `AddMemberToGroupCommand` object.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddMemberToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddMemberToGroupCommand()`.
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()` to handle adding members to group.
** Pros: This implementation does not require a new command to be created.
** Cons: This implementation is less flexible.

=== Delete Member From Group feature

Fastis deletes a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The delete member from groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports deleting a member to Group objects to the address book. `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteMemberFromGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage.
The `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` will retrieve the input, which is the index of the person of the last updated person list, and deletes that person from the list if the person exists in the `UniquePersonList` in the specified group.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

<<fig34, Figure 34>>  shows the interaction of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command class.
[[fig34]]
.Class Diagram of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteMemberToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()`.
** Pros: This implementation does not require a new command to be created.
** Cons: This implementation is less flexible.

=== List Group Members Feature

Fastis lists all persons under the group keyed by user.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses `ListGroupMembersCommand` ,which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
group.

When user types in command line `listGroupMembers` or `lGM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
group and list out all members under the specified group in the `PersonListPanel`.

The `ListGroupMembersCommand` is facilitated by `ListGroupMembersCommandParser` to parse `ListGroupMembersCommand`.
<<fig37, Figure 37>> shows the flow of parsing of `ListGroupMembersCommand` object.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `ListGroupMembersCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a command to list out the members with same group.
** Pros: This implementation makes the methods called by command easily modifiable.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `ListGroupMembersCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy to edit `ListGroupMembersCommand()` easily to suit our needs
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Delete Group feature

Fastis deletes a group named by the user from input.

==== Current implementation

The delete groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting Group objects to the address book. DeleteGroupCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the DeleteGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The user executes a new `DeleteGroupCommand` with `Information`, to delete a existing group with the same information to the address book.
The group is deleted from the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

<<fig39, Figure 39>> shows the interaction of `DeleteGroup` Command class.
[[fig39]]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `deleteGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeDeleteGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation preserves `deleteGroup` functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `DeleteGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeDeleteGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: This implemetation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

// end::addGroup[]

// tag::ChangeTagColor[]
=== Tag Color feature
Fastis supports changing the color of the tags given to people in the address book. There are up to 17 colors to choose from.

==== Current implementation

Changing a tag's color is facilitated by `ChangeTagColorCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports modifying the `color` field within `Tag` objects.

The flow of operation is shown the <<fig42, Figure 42>> below.

[[fig42]]
.Sequence Diagram for `ChangeTagColor`.`
image::ChangeTagColorSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`ChangeTagColorCommand` inherit from `UndoableCommand`, therefore it can be undone and redone using `UndoRedoStack`.

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class ChangeTagColorCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // .. Get the tag's name and color from Model
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... Update tag in Model ...
        // ... Update Person list in Model ...
        // ... Return new CommandResult ...
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Colouring the tags

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow different tags with the same color
** Pros: This implementation allows users to have more freedom.
** Cons: This implementation might result in aesthetically unpleasing GUI.
* **Alternative 2:** Disallow different tags with the same color
** Pros: This implementation is more intuitive.
** Cons: This implementation makes the code longer.
// end::ChangeTagColor[]


// tag::addToDo[]
=== Add ToDo feature

Adds a to-do.

==== Current implementation

The add to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `AddToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding ToDo objects to the address book. AddToDoCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddToDoCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddToDoCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... add to-do logic ...
    }
}
----

The to-dos in the to-do list are facilitated by `ToDo` class. Each `ToDo` object have a `Content` object and a `Status` object, representing the content and status of the to-do.
Address book stores all to-dos in `UniqueToDoList`.
`ToDo`,`Content` and `UniqueToDoList` class reside inside `AddressBook`. <<fig43,Figure 43>> is the class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content`, `Status`, `UniqueToDoList` and `AddressBook`:
[[fig43]]
.Class Diagram for UniqueToDoList.
image::AddressBookUniqueToDoListToDoClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

On a smaller scale, <<fig44, Figure 44>> is a class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content` and `Status`:

[[fig44]]
.Class Diagram for To-Do.
image::ToDoStatusContentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UniqueToDoList` in the address book will be empty if no to-dos have been added previously.

The user executes a new `AddToDoCommand` with `Content`, to add a new to-do to the address book.
The `Status` of the to-do is "undone" by default.
The new to-do with content and status is added to the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig45, Figure 45>> shows how the addToDo operation works:

[[fig45]]
.Sequence Diagram for addToDo.
image::AddToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restrict the constructor of ToDo to be ToDo(Content content, Status status)`
** Pros: This implementation allows ToDo class to be easier to maintain and debug.
** Cons: This implementation requires extensive refactor of existing tests.
// end::addToDo[]

// tag::checkToDo[]
=== Check/UnCheck ToDo feature

Checks or unchecks a To-do

==== Current implementation

The check/uncheck to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Status objects within ToDo objects. CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

Similar to `Content` object, each `ToDo` object have a `Status` object, representing the status of the to-do.
The status of a to-do can be either `done` or `undone`.

When user check/uncheck an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the existing `ToDo`'s `Content` and appropriate new `Status`.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig46, Figure 46>> shows how the checkToDo operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setStatus(Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::checkToDo[]

// tag::editToDo[]
=== Edit ToDo feature

Edits a To-do.

==== Current implementation

The edit to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `EditToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Content objects within ToDo objects. EditToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, EditToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user edit an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the new `Content` and a new `Status` of "undone" value.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig48, Figure 48>> shows how the editToDo operation works:
[[fig48]]
.Sequence Diagram for EditToDo.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `EditToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setContentAndStatus(Content content, Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::editToDo[]

// tag::deleteToDo[]
=== Delete ToDo feature

Deletes a To-Do.

==== Current implementation

The delete to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting ToDo objects. DeleteToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user delete an existing to-do of specific `Index`, the `UniqueToDoList` within `AddressBook` is updated and stored in the `StorageManager`.

<<fig49, Figure 49>> shows how the deleteToDo operation works:
[[fig49]]
.Sequence Diagram for DeleteToDo.

// end::deleteToDo[]


=== Logging

Fastis uses the `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations:

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

Listed below are the different logging levels:

* `SEVERE` : Critical problems detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Non-Critical problems that allows the application to continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

This section provides necessary information for developers to edit and publish related documentations, such as User Guide and Developer Guide, for Fastis.

Fastis uses asciidoc for documentation.


[NOTE]
Asciidoc is chosen over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

The project uses https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section documents how to run the tests on Fastis.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.


*Method 1: Using Gradle in headless mode (recommended)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[TIP]
The above-mentioned method is the most reliable. The other two listed below might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

Using Gradle without the headless mode will cause GUI tests to show up on screen. The test functions will simulate mouse movement and keyboard keystrokes, and tests might fail if you move your mouse or type anything on the keyboard. Thus during the GUI tests it is recommended that you leave your machine alone.

To run the tests, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

Using this method, GUI tests will also show up on screen, and will require you to stop mouse and keyboard activity in order to run successfully.

This method requires you to have the project open on IntelliJ:

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`


=== Types of tests

Fastis has two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
