== PROJECT: Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers

---

== Overview
The Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) application for Social Workers is a desktop client used to help
social workers manage their day-to-day operations. By creating an easy to use command-line interface with graphical
elements, social workers can quickly manage their contacts (e.g. beneficiaries) as well as their
schedule (i.e. their calendar and daily schedule) from one central location efficiently via the command line.
In addition to a fully-featured address book and calendar through the use of command line input,
the client also allows for social workers to take session notes and attach them to their
beneficiaries, as well as generate an optimal route of their daily schedule to help organize their day.

On top of these features, a robust login system was implemented such that multiple users can securely
switch between different accounts and have distinct address books, session reports, and calendars
isolated from each other. Thus, not only does this allow for increased security, but it also
allows for multiple users to use the same application on the same system, which has the added
benefit of saving money as several people can share the same application on the same system
without affecting the data of another person.

The social worker is to interact with the application primarily through the command line. The GUI was created
using JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*: added a *authentication feature* and *multi-user capability*

** *What it does:*
*** *Authentication feature*: Users can login and logout from their application with a unique username and password.

*** *Multi-user Capability*: The application now supports multiple users, each having their own contacts and SLAP.

*** *Justification*: Firstly, this feature increases the security capability of the application. As the patient details and session
reports are sensitive data, having to authenticate first helps to maintain a level of confidentiality and integrity. Secondly,
it converts the application from single-user to multi-user, hence allow for multiple social workers to use the app. This is useful
in the scenario, where there is a mandate to use a single company laptop.

*** *Highlights*: The authentication and multi-user feature requires an in-depth analysis of the previous architecture before implementation.
It involves editing in almost all of the components with more emphasis on the Model and Storage components. An understanding of the n-tier
architecture is needed as the User Database mimics thats of the AddressBook. It is also a step towards making it a centralised application
that could be used by institutes of social workers.


*Minor enhancement*: added a *add session reports* feature


** What it does: This feature allows the user to add a new session report/log to the list of existing session reports/logs.

*** Justification: This is to allow social workers to keep records of their reports and also to collate into one single display.
This is a crucial feature of the application for social workers to store their information conveniently.
