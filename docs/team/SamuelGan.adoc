== PROJECT: NUSCouples

---

== Overview

NUSCouples is a desktop application targeted at couples studying in the National University of Singapore (NUS).
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented a *journal in _NUSCouples_.*
** What it does: allows the user to write, edit and save journal entries.
** Justification: this feature allows the user to record their thoughts and feelings as and when they want to. This is especially
useful when one is in a relationship.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a command to compare and display the common breaks in the NUSMods timetable of the person
stored in NUSCouples along with one other given timetable. Removed dependency on addressbook as a middle man. Since our project is
targeted towards couples, we only need to hold one person. Thus, I reimplemented addressbook methods to apply to only one person.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/traceurgan.md[Functional code]]
