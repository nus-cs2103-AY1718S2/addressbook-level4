== Summary of contributions

=== New feature: Auto-completion
==== Why?

Without auto-completion feature, users need to spend lots of their precious time just to type long commands and think of what missing fields they need to complete their commands. Auto-completion helps users save their time and effort so that they can enjoy interesting features of the application.
