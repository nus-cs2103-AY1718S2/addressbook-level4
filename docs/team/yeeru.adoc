== PROJECT: ProgressChecker

---

== Overview

ProgressChecker is *a desktop application for CS2103/T students to have a centralized hub that tracks their learning progress and project development* throughout the module. The current release is meant to be used alongside with CS2103/T module website. ProgressChecker has a JavaFX GUI, but users will interact with it via CLI for efficiency.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view and answer weekly exercises* taken from CS2103/T module website
** *What it does:* allows students to view exercises by week and save their answers down for it. Answers are stored automatically and loaded the next time the software runs.
** *Justification:* students face significant issues in finding or saving their exercises answers down in the module website for revision purposes; now they can easily do those with this feature
** *Highlights:* This enhancement touches on all 4 components in the code base. It required an in-depth analysis of the existing architecture on how each components work with one another in order to implement it in an optimal way.
** *Credits:* Much of the implementation was heavily inspired by the existing code base that has originally implemented the listing, modifying and storing of persons.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a view command that allows the user to navigate between different window tabs of information
