== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview

AddressBook - Level 4 is a desktop Smart Insurance Collection application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to open a *detailed description page* of a person in the addressbook
** What it does: When the user double clicks on the person card, a new window appears, allowing the user to see a detailed description of the person and allow them to edit certain details.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it makes it easier to keep track of multiple persons at a time. For example, one can open multiple customer pages and compare them side by side.
** Highlights: There were various parts of the app that required changed due to this enhancement. New FXML files needed to be created, as well as new event listeners. A description field was also added, which required changes in all parts of the application.
** Credits: Took parts from the PersonCard.java file as a base, but heavily expanded on it.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an Age field to help identify users more clearly. The user is able to add a new customer with an age by specifying /age to the argument.

* *Code contributed*:
** Functional: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T15-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/jstarw.md]
** Test: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T15-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/jstarw.md]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Released tag version `1.3` on Github
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Changed most functional tests to pass Travis tests when adding Age field.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== Opening Person Detail Window: `show`

This is a feature that allows users to open a new window with the person's details.
Format: `show NAME_OF_THE_PERSON`

[TIP]
The full name should be specified, since the command will scan for all contacts in order and show the first person it
finds which matches the fields

Examples:

* `show John Doe`
* `show Jonathan Wen`

Another option is to open the window up using the GUI. In order to do this:

1. Ensure that at least 1 contact exists in the addressbook.
2. Navigate to the PersonCard on the left side of the application.
3. Double click on the card to bring up the popup window.
4. When done viewing the details, close the window.

Multiple of these windows can be open at a time, allowing the user to compare contacts side by side.

=== New Person Detail Popup Window

A new window will pop up that will show a detailed page of a customer when the user double clicks the person card. This
is demonstrated as such:

This window will show various aspects of the customer, including a description that the user can add. Additionally, the
use can change certain details by simply double clicking on each field and edit them.

==== Current Implementation

A new `.fxml` file is created that will display the persons attributes on a new window. A new event called
`PersonCardDoubleClick` is created. This will listen to anytime a person card is double clicked. Subscribed listeners
(eg. BrowserPanel) will be alerted and the new window will open.

It can also be opened using the `show` command. This takes in a name and scans the entire addressbook. Once the first
person is found which matches the name, the window pops up. The matching is the same logic as the `find` command.

=== Age Field feature (V1.2)
==== Current implementation

One of the features that was added is the age field. When adding a new person to the addressbook now, the user must
specify the age of the new person. This will allow the user to have a more accurate description of the client, and
come up with a better insurance policy.

To add a person with an age field, one must specify the age prefixed with the indicator `/age`:


==== Future Improvements
* Include the age field when performing predictions
* Filter clients by their age
