== Introduction
*<<ReciRecipe,ReciRecipé>>* is a desktop recipe storage application for users who prefer using the keyboard instead of a mouse for efficient management. It is useful for tech-savvy cooks that want all their recipes stored in one place.

This *Developer Guide* will take you through the design and implementation of *ReciRecipé*. It takes a top-down approach in explaining the design, beginning from the architecture of the entire application before moving into the specifics of how some functions are implemented.
If you are new to development, you can choose a component in the architecture that you are more comfortable with and start there first.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

You will need these components installed on your computer:

. JDK 1.8.0_60 or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. IntelliJ IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to *File > Settings > Plugins* to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project

Follow these steps carefully to set up ReciRecipé on your computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click *File > Close Project* to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click *Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure*.
.. Click *New...* and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click *Import Project*.
. Locate the *build.gradle* file and select it. Click *OK*.
. Click *Open as Project*.
. Click *OK* to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Complete the following steps to verify the setup:

. Run the `seedu.recipe.MainApp` to see if it can starts.
. Try some simple commands to see if the app can respond.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to *File > Settings...* (Windows/Linux), or *IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences...* (macOS).
. Select *Editor > Code Style > Java*.
. Click on the *Imports* tab to set the order.

* For **Class count to use import with '\*'** and **Names count to use static import with '*'**: Set to *999* to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For *Import Layout*: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

IntelliJ should look like <<fig-CodeStyleImports>> below after step 3.

[[fig-CodeStyleImports]]
.Code Style Imports
image::CodeStyleImports.png[width="400"]

{nbsp} +

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure IntelliJ to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (<<CI, CI>>) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[discrete]
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture diagram given below (<<fig-ArchitectureDiagram>>) explains the high-level design of the App with 6 components.

[[fig-ArchitectureDiagram]]
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
{nbsp} +

[TIP]
The *.pptx* files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the *.pptx* file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose *Save as picture*.

Given below is a quick overview of each component:

. <<Design-Main,*`Main`*>>: Contains the initializing, starting-up and exiting of the app.
. <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>: Contains classes that are used by the following 4 components, `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage`.
. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Contains the UI of the app.
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Contains the commands of the app.
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Contains the the data of the app in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Contains the interaction of the app with the external memory, which consists of reading from and writing to the hard disk.

Each of the four components <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>, <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>, <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>

* Defines its <<API,API>> in an interface with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> component (see the class diagram given below) defines its <<API,API>> in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

In general, the components are designed in such a way that their interactions are being driven by events. And we will now give an example of what happens when a command is being executed.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (<<fig-ComponentInteraction>>) shows how the components interact in the scenario where the user issues the command *`delete 1`*.

[[fig-ComponentInteraction]]
.Component interactions for *`delete 1`* command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteRecipe.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> simply raises a `_RecipeBookChangedEvent_` when the Recipe Book data are changed, instead of asking the <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `_EventsCenter_` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for *`delete 1`* command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteRecipeEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `_EventsCenter_` to the <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> and <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> without <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main component
<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>> has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].

* At app launch: Initializes all the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons component
<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `_EventsCenter_` :  Used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design). Written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library].
* `_LogsCenter_` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `_MainWindow_` that is made up of smaller parts, for example, `_CommandBox_`, `_ResultDisplay_`, `_RecipeListPanel_`, `_StatusBarFooter_`, `_BrowserPanel_`, etc. All these, including the `_MainWindow_`, inherit from the abstract `_UiPart_` class (See <<fig-UiClassDiagram>>).

[[fig-UiClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

The <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching *.fxml* files that are in the *src/main/resources/view* folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[MainWindow.fxml].

The <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> component:

* Executes user commands using the <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> component.
* Binds itself to some data in the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> so that the UI can auto-update when data in the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the app and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> contains all commands and this is how <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> reacts when the user submits a command:

.  <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> uses the `_RecipeBookParser_` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `_Command_` object which is executed by the `_LogicManager_`.
.  The command execution can affect the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> (e.g. adding a recipe) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `_CommandResult_` object which is passed back to the <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>.

For an overview of the structure of the <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> component, refer to the diagram below <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]

{nbsp} +

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>,

* stores a `_UserPref_` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Recipe Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `_ObservableList<Recipe>_` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

Refer to diagram below <<fig-ModelClassDiagram>>.

[[fig-ModelClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> component,

* can save `_UserPref_` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the Recipe Book data in XML format and read it back.

Refer to diagram below <<fig-StorageClassDiagram>>.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
// tag::auto-compeltion[]
=== Auto-completion
==== Current implementation

Formerly, users need to type all application keywords and their inputs to the command line. Auto-completion feature is implemented to help users shorten the commands they need to type, by giving suggestions of words based on current input of users and automatically filling chosen words into input field.

Currently, a class called `_SuggestionsPopUp_`, which inherits from `_ContextMenu_`, is created to handle all operations relating to auto-completion. The operations include displaying a pop-up menu consisting of suggestions for user’s input, automatically completing input field when a word is chosen and hiding the pop-up menu.

Key combination kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[Tab] is used to show suggestion pop-up. For other keys and key combinations, the pop-up is hidden. The code to handle these key and key combination actions is shown below:

[source,java]
----
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
    suggestionsPopUp.hideSuggestions();
    if (SHOW_SUGGESTIONS_COMMAND.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        suggestionsPopUp.showSuggestions();
    }
    // Other key combinations
}
----

To display suggestions, first, a suggestion list is built, then the position of the pop-up menu is calculated for display.

Suggestion list is built with a given list as a dictionary and last word in user input as a word that needs to be looked up. All words in the dictionary that take given word as prefix are valid suggestions and added to the list. However, since `_CommandBox_` is limited, only a small number of words are added to the pop-up menu. The code for compiling suggestion list is given below:

[source,java]
----
for (String suggestion : dictionary) {
    if (suggestion.startsWith(prefix)) {
        addSuggestion(suggestion);
    }

    if (getItems().size() == MAX_SUGGESTIONS) {
        break;
    }
}
----

The given dictionary and the constant `MAX_SUGGESTIONS` can be found in `_AutoCompletionUtil_` class. All operations with input text such as finding the last word of user's input are supported by `_TextInputProcessorUtil_` class.

To calculate position to display pop-up menu, height and width of input text (in pixels) are computed and then used to determine display position in the main window. Height and width of input text are calculated in `_TextInputProcessorUtil_` class.

Then, the suggestion list can be shown in main window.

To hide the suggestion list, a method called `hide()` is implemented as below:

[source,java]
----
protected void hideSuggestions() {
    if  (isShowing()) {
        hide();
    }
}
----

To automatically fill input field with chosen word, an `EventListener` is attached to each item in the pop-up menu. When an item is chosen, it replaces the last word in input field with the word associated with the item. The code is shown below:

[source,java]
----
item.setOnAction(event -> commandBox.replaceText(textInputProcessor.replaceLastWord(item.getText())));
----

`_TextInputProcessorUtil_` object `textInputProcessor` is used to handle an operation `replaceLastWord()` for the given text.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Base class of SuggestionsPopUp.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `_ContextMenu_`.
** Pros: Easy to use since `_ContextMenu_` and `_TextArea_` are in the same library `javafx.scene.control`.
** Cons: Dependent on `_TextArea_` in `_CommandBox_` class.
* **Alternative 2:** `_JPopupMenu_`
** Pros: NA.
** Cons: Need additional work to make `_JPopupMenu_` compatible with `_TextArea_`.

===== Aspect: Abstraction of `_SuggestionsPopUp_`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate class `_SuggestionsPopUp_`.
** Pros: More intuitive approach since `_SuggestionsPopUp_` is a component in `UI`.
** Cons: Need to take extra information from `_CommandBox_` class.
* **Alternative 2:** An inner class of `_CommandBox_` class.
** Pros: Easy to implement since it has access to all attributes and methods of `_CommandBox_`.
** Cons: Limitations in reusability.

===== Aspect: Abstraction of `_TextInputProcessorUtil_`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate class `_TextInputProcessorUtil_`.
** Pros: Common functions easily used by other classes if needed.
** Cons: NA.
* **Alternative 2:** An inner class of `_SuggestionsPopUp_` class.
** Pros: Convenient to use inside the containing class.
** Cons: Limitations in reusability.
// end::auto-completion[]

=== Changing theme
// tag::change-theme[]
==== Current implementation

The command is implemented in `_ChangeThemeCommand_`. When user submits the command to the *`UI`* component, it passes on the command to the *`Logic`* component, which posts a `_ChangeThemeRequestEvent_` to the `_EventsCenter_`. For more details, refer to <<fig-ChangeThemeSD>>).

[[fig-ChangeThemeSD]]
.Component interactions for *`theme`* command (part 1)
image::SDforChangeTheme.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

The event is then propagated through the `_EventsCenter_` to the `*UI*`. The `*UI*` will call `handleChangeThemeRequestEvent()` to update the theme accordingly. To understand the execution better, refer to <<fig-ChangeThemeEventSD>>).

[[fig-ChangeThemeEventSD]]
.Component interactions for *`theme`* command (part 2)
image::SDforChangeThemeEventHandling.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

`handleChangeThemeRequestEvent()` will then log the event trigger and call `handleChangeTheme()`.

[NOTE]
If the command is called directly from the menu bar, `handleChangeTheme()` will be called instead of `handleChangeThemeRequestEvent()`.

`handleChangeTheme()` gets the current theme from `_UserPref_` then:

. Changes the main page loaded on the `_BrowserPanel_`.
. Changes the style using on the `_Stage_`.

To understand the interaction between the components, refer to <<fig-ChangeThemeDetailsSD>>):

[[fig-ChangeThemeDetailsSD]]
.Component interactions for `handleChangeTheme()`
image::SDforChangeThemeDetails.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

Below is the implementation for the two operations:

[source,java]
----
public void loadDefaultPage(boolean isDarkTheme) {
    if (!isLoaded()) {
        URL defaultPage;
        if (isDarkTheme) {
            defaultPage = MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + DEFAULT_PAGE_DARK);
        } else {
            defaultPage = MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + DEFAULT_PAGE_LIGHT);
        }
        loadPage(defaultPage.toExternalForm());
    }
}

private void loadStyle(boolean darkTheme) {
    Scene scene = primaryStage.getScene();
    scene.getStylesheets().clear();
    if (darkTheme) {
        scene.getStylesheets().add(MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + DARK_THEME_CSS).toExternalForm());
    } else {
        scene.getStylesheets().add(MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + LIGHT_THEME_CSS).toExternalForm());
    }
    scene.getStylesheets().add(MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + EXTENSIONS_CSS).toExternalForm());
    primaryStage.setScene(scene);
    primaryStage.show();
}
----

[NOTE]
Currently the implementation of `loadDefaultPage()` reloads the `_BrowserPanel_` so if any page is loaded on the `_BrowserPanel_`, it will be lost during changing theme.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Handling of default page in `_BrowserPanel_`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reload the default page if there is nothing loaded in `_BrowserPanel_`.
** Pros: This would prevent any previously loaded page from being lost.
** Cons: This approach requires extra work to detect if there is any page loaded in `_BrowserPanel_`.
* **Alternative 2:** Reload the style for the default page.
** Pros: It is possible to keep the status of the `_BrowserPanel_`, in other words, any page loaded may still retain.
** Cons: It is not entirely sure if this implementation is possible.
* **Alternative 3:** Reload the default page.
** Pros: It is easy to implement. This was the implementation until v1.5rc.
** Cons: This causes any page loaded on `_BrowserPanel_` to be lost during the operation.
* **Alternative 4:** Stop using the default page.
** Pros: It is relatively easy to implement.
** Cons: There is no default page to display so we have to find another approach to make `_BrowserPanel_` display something as a placeholder, *without* using a default page.
// end::change-theme[]

// tag::cloud-storage[]
=== Cloud storage support
==== Current implementation

A new command `_UploadCommand_` has been added to allow users to upload data in the recipe book onto the cloud. `_UploadCommandParser_` takes in and checks the `_String_` filename, adds an XML extension to it before saving it to `_CloudStorageUtil_` and parsing it to `_UploadCommand_`.
Adding the XML extension is to make the command more user-friendly and to maintain integrity of the data since the application can only read data from files in an XML format.

`_UploadCommandParser_` parses the user-input as shown below:

[source,java]
----
String XmlExtensionFilename = ParserUtil.parseFilename(filename);
----
The `parseFilename` method will then call `isValidFilename` to make sure that the user input does not contain characters restricted by Dropbox for filenames.

[source,java]
----
private static final String FILENAME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[^\\Q<>:/|.?\"\\*\\E\\s]+";
/**
 * Returns true if a given string is a valid filename.
 */
public static boolean isValidFilename(String test) {
    return test.matches(FILENAME_VALIDATION_REGEX);
}
----
Because the file is being uploaded to the user's Dropbox account, they will be prompted to authorize ReciRecipe if it is their first time connecting to Dropbox.
After authorization the user will copy and paste the authorization code given by using the *`token`* command.
The code will then be converted into a unique access token that will be stored in `CloudStorageUtil` for that session.

[source,java]
----
public static void processAuthorizationCode(String code) {
    // Converts authorization code to access token
    DbxAppInfo appInfo = new DbxAppInfo(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET);
    DbxWebAuth webAuth = new DbxWebAuth(config, appInfo);
    try {
        DbxAuthFinish authFinish = webAuth.finishFromCode(code);
        accessToken = authFinish.getAccessToken();
    } catch (DbxException e) {
        throw new AssertionError(UploadCommand.MESSAGE_FAILURE + " Invalid authorization code");
    }
    upload();
}
----
Since the access token will be saved in the application for the current session, any subsequent calls to the *`upload`* command
will skip the above `processAuthorizationCode` method and skip straight to the `upload()` method.

Furthermore, to overcome the problem with conflicting filenames that already exist in the user's dropbox, we turned on the auto-renaming which will append a (#) to the filename while uploading.

[source,java]
----
try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(RECIPE_BOOK_FILE)) {
        client.files().uploadBuilder("/" + uploadFilename)
                .withAutorename(true)
                .uploadAndFinish(in);
----

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Handling of the access token.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save it for the current session.
** Pros: It is more convenient as the user does not have to keep logging in to their Dropbox account every time they want to upload.
** Cons: There will be security concerns since there is no security aspect to our application at all.
* **Alternative 2:** One-time usage of the access token.
** Pros: There will be less security issues/concerns.
** Cons: This is very inconvenient as it requires the user to keep logging in to their Dropbox account every time they want to upload.
// end::cloud-storage[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: *config.json*).

// tag::displaying-a-recipe[]
=== Displaying a recipe
[discrete]
==== Current Implementation

The text from a selected recipe is always displayed in the `_ResultDisplay_`.

When a recipe has an embedded URL, the browser panel displays the web page of the URL. Otherwise, it shows a HTML formatted recipe.

The `_HtmlFormatter_` class is responsible for the HTML formatting of a recipe.

// end::displaying-a-recipe[]

=== Downloading an image

// tag::download-image[]
==== Current Implementation

When an *`add`* or *`edit`* command has an image field input, that input will be checked if it is a valid image URL using `ImageIO` (implementation below).
[source,java]
----
public static boolean isValidImageUrl(String testUrl) {
    URL imageUrl;
    try {
        imageUrl = new URL(testUrl);
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        return false;
    }

    BufferedImage image;
    try {
        image = ImageIO.read(imageUrl);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        LogsCenter.getLogger(Image.class).warning("Cannot get image from "
                + testUrl + ". It is likely the app is not connected to the Internet.");
        return false;
    }

    if (image != null) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
----

If the input is indeed a URL that links to an image, `ImageDownloader` will go through several steps to download the image and set the new image path (<<fig-DownloadImageAD>>).

[[fig-DownloadImageAD]]
.Activity diagram of an image downloading process
image::DownloadImageAD.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

A particular step that might seems out of place here is the checksum calculation. Because the `BufferedImage` object created by `ImageIO` has different hash code based on the execution configuration, using `hashCode()` does not guarantee the same file name for an image. However, we can be sure the same image data will return the same <<MD5>> checksum, and MD5 checksum is sufficient for the scale of our product. Therefore, using MD5 checksum for the file name will almost guarantee no hash collision and no image duplication. +
Below is the implementation of `downloadImage()`:

[source,java]
----
public static String downloadImage(String imageUrlString) {
    assert isValidImageUrl(imageUrlString);

    try {
        byte[] imageData = getImageData(imageUrlString);
        String md5Checksum = calculateMd5Checksum(imageData);
        String filePath = getImageFilePathFromImageName(md5Checksum);
        File file = prepareImageFile(filePath);
        if (file != null) {
            writeDataToFile(imageData, file);
            return filePath;
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    /* Exceptions catching */
----

For the detailed implementation of each step, see link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/ImageDownloader.java[`ImageDownloader.java`].

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Image file name.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use MD5 of the image data.
** Pros: MD5 can ensure that there won't be duplicates of an image.
** Cons: MD5 is significantly more computationally expensive compared to a simple `hashCode()`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `hashCode()` of the `BufferedImage` object.
** Pros: This approach is simple, fast, easy to implement.
** Cons: Due to the way `hashCode()` works, different run configurations will make `hashCode()` return different values. Therefore, it is always certain that the same image from one URL will be downloaded several times into several duplicates.
* **Alternative 3:** Use the recipe name.
** Pros: This is by far the most intuitive approach.
** Cons: However this approach looks a lot easier than it seems. Furthermore, it would be hard to update the file name if the recipe name is changed.
// end::download-image[]

// tag::embedded-url[]
=== Embedded URL

==== Current Implementation

The URL field is an optional field in the *`add`* command and can be omitted. In the case when a URL is embedded to a recipe, the `_BrowserPanel_` will load the given URL.

As seen below, the URL is not a required parameter during the checking of prefixes in an *`add`* command.

[source,java]
----
if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_INSTRUCTION, PREFIX_PREPARATION_TIME,
    PREFIX_INGREDIENT) || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
----

In the case when a URL is not added to a recipe, a null reference '-' is put as a placeholder when parsing the URL field, unlike tag labels. This helps with identifying recipes that do not have embedded URLs.

[source,java]
----
public static Optional<Url> parseUrlOnInitialAdd(Optional<String> url) throws IllegalValueException {
    requireNonNull(url);
    return url.isPresent() ? Optional.of(parseUrl(url.get())) : Optional.of(getNullReferenceUrl());
}
----

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of optional property.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a placeholder for omitted URL.
** Pros: A simple implementation can be used as a reference by new developers for creating optional fields. The interaction with `_BrowserPanel_` requires more control over the status of a recipe's URL property.
** Cons: The `_Recipe_` class may contain unnecessary variables.
* **Alternative 2:** Store URL property in the same fashion as tag labels.
** Pros: The `_Recipe_` class has better separation of optional and compulsory properties.
** Cons: The more complex implementation may confuse new developers, and the interaction with other components may become needlessly complex.
// end::embedded-url[]

// tag::facebook-compatibility[]
=== Facebook compatibility
==== Current Implementation

The *`share`* command is implemented in the `_ShareCommand_` class. On command execution, a new `_ShareRecipeEvent_` is created (with parameters index and recipe) and posted to the `_EventsCenter_`.

The event is then propagated through the `_EventsCenter_` to the `_BrowserPanel_`, which is supported by the `_FacebookHandler_` class (contains methods for Facebook integration and authentication).

The `_BrowserPanel_` will call `handleShareRecipeEvent()` and update the web view to show the Facebook authentication page. The recipe name, ingredients, and instructions, are also formatted and copied to the clipboard.

The `_recipe_` class handles the formatting of the recipe text before it is copied to the clipboard:

[source,java]
----
public String getTextFormattedRecipe() {
    return NAME_HEADER + getName() + LINE_BREAK
            + INGREDIENTS_HEADER + getIngredient() + LINE_BREAK
            + INSTRUCTIONS_HEADER + getInstruction() + LINE_BREAK;
}
----

The method for copying a string to the clipboard is implemented in the `_UiUtil_` class. This makes the method reusable by other UI classes.

[source,java]
----
public static void copyToClipboard(String string) {
    Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
    Clipboard clipboard = toolkit.getSystemClipboard();
    StringSelection stringSelection = new StringSelection(string);
    clipboard.setContents(stringSelection, null);
}
----

Upon logging in, the User will be shown a feed dialog with the embedded URL of the recipe. The user may choose to input any text into the post (eg. pasting the copied recipe from clipboard). The User then has to manually click "post" before an actual Facebook post is made.

The `_BrowserPanel_` will be updated to show the Facebook feed of the User.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of Facebook sharing.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a feed dialog.
** Pros: The user has more control over what is posted on their Facebook wall, and the implementation is easier to maintain.
** Cons: The user has to take more steps to successfully make a post (paste recipe onto post, click "post").
* **Alternative 2:** Use RestFB API.
** Pros: The recipe will be posted immediately on the user's Facebook wall using the *`share`* command. The user need not manually paste the recipe from the clipboard onto the post.
** Cons: The user *must* manually obtain their Facebook access key and input it into the application - this may raise security concerns (Facebook does not allow automatic posting of text even if permission is given by the user upon log in).
// end::facebook-compatibility[]

// tag::inserting-an-image[]
=== Inserting an image
==== Current Implementation

The image field is an optional field in the *`add`* command and can be omitted. A user can add an image to a recipe by inserting the absolute path name of the image into the image field.

An `_ImageView_` has been inserted into RecipeListCard.fxml so that the image can also be displayed on the recipe card. The image is set in the `_RecipeCard_` class, which is the controller for the FXML file. This is shown below:

[source,java]
----
    FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(recipe.getImage().toString());
    Image image = new Image(input);
    imageView.setImage(image);
----

The recipe image is displayed using an <img> HTML tag in the HTML formatted recipe.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of inserting image.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Insert the absolute image path during an *`add`* command.
** Pros: There is no need for a mouse. This ensures that the application still uses Command Line Interface for important operations.
** Cons: The user may take a significant amount of time to type out the image path.
* **Alternative 2 :** Drag and drop an image onto the GUI.
** Pros: This implementation is more intuitive for the user as there is no need to deal with image paths.
** Cons: It deviates from the idea of a Command Line Interface.
// end::inserting-an-image[]

=== Keyboard shortcuts
// tag::keyboard-shortcut[]
==== Current implementation

Currently, only `_CommandBox_` accepts keyboard shortcuts. All shortcuts are stored in the `_KeyboardShortcutsMapping_` class inside the `UI` component. `_CommandBox_` listens for key combinations and executes actions mapped to these key presses, which are defined in the `handleKeyPress()` method as shown below:

[source,java]
----
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
    if (COMMAND_SUBMISSION.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        submitCommand();
    } else if (LAST_COMMAND.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        navigateToPreviousInput();
    } else if (NEXT_COMMAND.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        navigateToNextInput();
    } else if (NEW_LINE_IN_COMMAND.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        createNewLine();
    }
    // Can have more mappings
}
----

As seen from above, all key combinations implemented consume the default effect of the combinations. However, this is not a must as there may be future mappings that do not require consuming the `KeyEvent`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Location of the shortcuts.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store in the `_KeyboardShortcutsMapping_` class.
** Pros: There is good modularity, making it easier to keep track of the mappings.
** Cons: The shortcuts have to be imported to be used.
* **Alternative 2:** Store in the `_CommandBox_` class.
** Pros: There is no need for imports. Furthermore, it is possible to declare new mappings on the run and use it directly in the `_CommandBox_`.
** Cons: It is impossible to use them if we want to implement shortcuts for other UI components or globally.
// end::keyboard-shortcut[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `_LogsCenter_` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through the console and to a *.log* file.

*Logging Levels*

* *SEVERE* : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* *WARNING* : Can continue, but with caution.
* *INFO* : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* *FINE* : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Multiple lines input support
// tag::multiple-lines[]
==== Current implementation

Former implementation of the `_CommandBox_` used `_TextField_`, which only allows single-line inputs but supports automatic handler of kbd:[Enter]. To support commands with multiple lines, another class has to be used for `_CommandBox_`. The current implementation of `_CommandBox_`
uses `_TextArea_`, a class which has fewer restrictions on the number of input lines allowed. However, the trade off for `_TextArea_` is that it does not support automatic handler of kbd:[Enter].

Currently, the solution for this is to consume the use of kbd:[Enter] and invoke the function `submitCommand()` whenever RecipeBook receives a keyboard combination that is assigned to command submission (default is kbd:[Enter]).

[source,java]
----
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
    // COMMAND_SUBMISSION default is KeyCode.ENTER
    if (COMMAND_SUBMISSION.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        submitCommand();
    }
    // Other keyboard combinations
}
----

Because the default use of kbd:[Enter] has been replaced by command submission, another key combination is used for line breaks. The default combination for line breaks is kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[Enter] (like in Facebook). Note that these two combinations, line breaks and command submission, are interchangeable according to how the user setups *ReciRecipé* preferences.

When RecipeBook receives a keyboard combination that is assigned to line breaks (default is kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[Enter]), `_CommandBox_` generates a `_StringBuilder_` from current text inside `_CommandBox_`, gets the caret location. The `_StringBuilder_` then inserts a new line at the given caret location, returns a `_String_` and `_CommandBox_` replaces its entire body with the new `_String_`.

The implementation of line breaks is below:
[source,java]
----
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
    // NEW_LINE_IN_COMMAND default is KeyCodeCombination(KeyCode.SHIFT, KeyCode.ENTER)
    if (NEW_LINE_IN_COMMAND.match(keyEvent)) {
        keyEvent.consume();
        createNewLine();
    }
    // Other keyboard combinations
}

private void createNewLine() {
    int caretPosition = commandTextArea.getCaretPosition();
    StringBuilder commandTextStringBuilder = new StringBuilder(commandTextArea.getText());
    commandTextStringBuilder.insert(caretPosition, LF);
    String newCommandText = commandTextStringBuilder.toString();
    commandTextArea.setText(newCommandText);
    commandTextArea.positionCaret(caretPosition + 1);
}
----

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Usage of a component that support multiple lines input.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `_TextArea_`.
** Pros: It is easy to use and very intuitive.
** Cons: The <<CSS,CSS>> is particularly hard to handle due to the way `_TextArea_` and its body function separately. There is no default handler for kbd:[Enter].
* **Alternative 2:** `_TextField_` with support for `\n`.
** Pros: It hardly requires any changes to the code.
** Cons: The inputs are unintuitive and ugly. Also, a long line with hundreds of characters is unavoidable. Once the line gets too long, it is nearly impossible to make changes to the input.
* **Alternative 3:** `HTMLEditor`.
** Pros: There are abundant formatting features.
** Cons: It is too complex to implement and contains unintuitive inputs.
// end::multiple-lines[]

=== Parsing a recipe from BrowserPanel
// tag::web-parse[]
==== Current implementation

The command is implemented in `_ParseCommand_`. When user submits the command to the *`UI`* component, it passes on the command to the *`Logic`* component, which posts a `_WebParseRequestEvent_` to the `_EventsCenter_`. For more details, refer to <<fig-ParseCommandSD>>.

[[fig-ParseCommandSD]]
.Component interactions for *`parse`* command (part 1)
image::SDforParseCommand.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

The event is then propagated through the `_EventsCenter_` to the `*UI*`. The `*UI*` will call `handleWebParseRequestEvent()`. The process is shown in <<fig-ParseCommandEventSD>> below.

[[fig-ParseCommandEventSD]]
.Component interactions for *`parse`* command (part 2)
image::SDforParseCommandEventHandling.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

This event needs to deal with two `UiPart`: `BrowserPanel` to parse the recipe, and `CommandBox` to automatically put in an `AddCommand` with the parsed recipe. +
Therefore, `handleWebParseRequestEvent()` is implemented in `MainWindow` class. Below is the implementation:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleWebParseRequestEvent(WebParseRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    String parsedRecipe = browserPanel.parseRecipe();
    if (parsedRecipe != null) {
        commandBox.replaceText(parsedRecipe);
    } else {
        commandBox.replaceText("");
    }
}
----

As seen from the implementation above, the `BrowserPanel` creates a `WebParser` according to the webpage loaded. It does so by calling its `WebParserHandler` and makes the `WebParserHandler` create the according `WebParser`. For example, if the URL is recipes.wikia.com/wiki/Hainanese_Chicken_Rice, then `WebParserHandler` will return `WikiaParser`. which is a class implementing the interface `WebParser`. Below is the implementation for this method:
[source,java]
----
public String parseRecipe() {
    WebParser webParser = webParserHandler.getWebParser();
    if (webParser != null) {
        return webParser.parseRecipe();
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
----

For the interactions between the three classes mentioned above, refer to <<fig-WebParserCD>> below.  +
{nbsp} +

[[fig-WebParserCD]]
.Class diagram for `_WebParser_`
image::WebParserClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

From the figure above, we see `WebParserHandler` takes in a `WebView`, which is the main part of the `BrowserPanel` and returns the corresponding `WebParser`. See implementation below:
[source,java]
----
public WebParser getWebParser() {
    String url = browser.getEngine().getLocation();
    if (browser.getEngine().getTitle() != null) {
        try {
            URI uri = new URI(url);
            String domain = uri.getHost();
            Document document = browser.getEngine().getDocument();
            W3CDom w3CDom = new W3CDom();
            String documentString = w3CDom.asString(document);

            switch (domain) {

            case WikiaParser.DOMAIN:
                return new WikiaParser(documentString);

            default:
                return null;

            }
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            return null;
        }
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
----

The `WebParser` in turn takes a string value of the HTML of the page loaded in the `WebView`, parses it then returns the parsed recipe. An example of how a `WebParser` works can be found at link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/util/WikiaParser.java[`WikiaParser.java`].

After we get a recipe, or to be exact, a string that contains the `add` command with the recipe, `MainWindow` passes `parsedRecipe`, which is now the string of an `add` command to the `CommandBox`. Then the `CommandBox` just replaces its body with the given string. See <<fig-ParseCommandDetailsSD>> for an example when a `parse` command is submitted with a wikia page loaded in the `Browserpanel`. +
{nbsp} +

{nbsp} +

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to extract data from `WebView`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Jsoup.
** Pros: It returns a Jsoup supported string, which will make parsing *significantly less painful* later.
** Cons: This approach uses a 3rd-party library.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a w3c.dom Document directly.
** Pros: This approach requires only one line of code.
** Cons: However, as we are going to see below, this method makes parsing almost impossible without a lot of trial-and-error.

===== Aspect: How to parse data from `WebView`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a Jsoup Document from a HTML string, then parse on it.
** Pros: This approach is the easiest to do as Jsoup is a very robust HTML parsing library, especially when you are familiar with the way JQuery selects elements.
** Cons: This approach uses a 3rd-party library.
* **Alternative 2:** Do DOM query on a w3c.dom Document directly.
** Pros: This approach uses the built-in Java codes.
** Cons: The DOM queries that have to be made are very expensive. Furthermore, IntelliJ does not support variable debugging on w3c.dom Document, which, as a result, makes parsing for the correct elements a game of lottery.

===== Aspect: Testing.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a dummy Document object for `WebParserHandler`.
** Pros: This is currently the only working approach.
** Cons: This approach does not fully test for the correctness of `WebParserHandler` constructor. Furthermore, the tests usually fail even though they should pass.
* **Alternative 2:** Do a correct test by using a long waiting time.
** Pros: This approach works.
** Cons: It makes testing a lot slower due to the long waiting time.
// end::web-parse[]

=== Searching on the internet
// tag::internet-search[]
==== Current implementation

The command is implemented in `_SearchCommand_`. When user submits the command to the *`UI`* component, it passes on the command to the *`Logic`* component, which creates a `_WikiaQueryHandler_` and posts a `_InternetSearchRequestEvent_` to the `_EventsCenter_`. For a visual understanding, refer to <<fig-InternetSearchSD>>.

[[fig-InternetSearchSD]]
.Component interactions for *`search chicken rice`* command (part 1)
image::SDforInternetSearch.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

The event is then propagated through the `_EventsCenter_` to the `*UI*`. The `*UI*` will call `handleInternetSearchRequestEvent()` to search for the recipe. For details on the execution events, refer to <<fig-InternetSearchEventSD>>.

[[fig-InternetSearchEventSD]]
.Component interactions for *`search chicken rice`* command (part 2)
image::SDforInternetSearchEventHandling.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

This command deals with a class called `_WikiaQueryHandler_`. `_WikiaQueryHandler_` is a class that resolves a query to http://recipes.wikia.com[the recipe repo] we are using for ReciRecipé.

`_WikiaQueryHandler_` takes in the argument of `_SearchCommand_`, makes a query (after going through many steps) to the server. Refer to <<fig-InternetSearchDetailsSD>> for the details.

[[fig-InternetSearchDetailsSD]]
.Component interactions for `_WikiaQueryHandler_`
image::SDforInternetSearchDetails.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

After `_WikiaQueryHandler_` is created, we can call `getRecipeQueryUrl()` and `getQueryNumberOfResults()` to get the URL for the `_BrowserPanel_` and the number of results returned by the query.

Refer to <<fig-InternetSearchCD>> for the interaction between relevant classes.

[[fig-InternetSearchCD]]
.Classes interactions for `_SearchCommand_`
image::InternetSearchClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

When `execute()` is called, `_SearchCommand_` passes its `_WikiaQueryHandler_` as an argument to `_InternetSearchRequestEvent_`. `_BrowserPanel_` will then call `getQueryNumberOfResults()` to see if the query returns any results. If there is no result, then `_BrowserPanel_` won't load the page to reduce needless requests to the server, else `_BrowserPanel_` will load the URL given by `getRecipeQueryUrl()`. Refer to the code snippet below to see the implementation for `execute()` and the handler.

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    int noOfResult = wikiaQueryHandler.getQueryNumberOfResults();

    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new InternetSearchRequestEvent(wikiaQueryHandler));

    if (noOfResult == 0) {
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
    } else {
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, noOfResult));
    }
}

private void handleInternetSearchRequestEvent(InternetSearchRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    if (event.wikiaQueryHandler.getQueryNumberOfResults() != 0) {
        loadPage(event.wikiaQueryHandler.getRecipeQueryUrl());
    }
}
----

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Usage of `_WikiaQueryHandler_`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `_WikiaQueryHandler_`.
** Pros: This approach allows more data to be processed separately from the page handling by `_BrowserPanel_`.
** Cons: In return, using a separate class makes the implementation a lot harder to manage.
* **Alternative 2:** Do not use `_WikiaQueryHandler_`. Let `_BrowserPanel_` directly load the query URL.
** Pros: This approach is significantly easier to implement, requiring only 3-4 lines in `_BrowserPanel_`.
** Cons: However, we don't get any extra information for pre-processing and this could lead to redundant requests.
// end::internet-search[]

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `_LogicManager_`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modify the state of the recipe book (e.g. *`add`*, *`edit`*). Such commands will inherit from `_UndoableCommand_`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `_Command_` instead. The following diagram  <<diag-LogicCommandClass>> shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

{nbsp} +

[[diag-LogicCommandClass]]
.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `_Command_` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `_DeleteCommand_`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the recipe book before execution. `_UndoableCommand_` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implement the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `_UndoableCommand_`, *`delete 5`*, to delete the 5th recipe in the recipe book. The current state of the recipe book is saved before the *`delete 5`* command executes. The *`delete 5`* command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` as seen in <<diag-UndoRedo1>> below (the current state is saved together with the command).

{nbsp} +

[[diag-UndoRedo1]]
.Undo/Redo Starting Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute *`add n/David ...`* to add a new recipe.
The state of the stack is shown in <<diag-UndoRedo2>> below.

{nbsp} +

[[diag-UndoRedo2]]
.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the recipe was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using *`undo`*.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`, thus restoring the recipe book to the state before the *`add`* command executed.
The details of the execution can be seen in <<diag-UndoRedo3>> below.

{nbsp} +

[[diag-UndoRedo3]]
.Execute Undo Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `_Exception_` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram <<diag-UndoRedoSeq>> shows how the undo operation works:

{nbsp} +

[[diag-UndoRedoSeq]]
.Undo/Redo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the recipe book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, *`clear`*. As before, *`clear`* will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer makes sense to redo the *`add n/David`* command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).
Details can be seen in <<diag-UndoRedo4>> below.

{nbsp} +

[[diag-UndoRedo4]]
.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp} +

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, *`list`*, which inherits from `_Command_` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution as can be seen in <<diag-CannotUndoRedo>> below.

{nbsp} +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `_UndoableCommand_`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`.
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behavior. Classes that deal with `_Command_` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is difficult for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`.
** Pros: This does not involve the template pattern, and is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: The classes that inherit from `_UndoableCommand_` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire recipe book.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: There may be performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: This will use less memory (e.g. for *`delete`*, as it just saves the recipe being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modify the recipe book (*`add`*, *`clear`*, *`edit`*).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: The user might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing *`undo`*.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: It might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: The user has no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo.
** Pros: This is easy to for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: The logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and can just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: This requires dealing with commands that have already been undone, meaning we must remember to skip these commands. It violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render *.adoc* files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your *.adoc* files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in web pages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the *docs/* directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the *build/docs* folder, right click on them and select *Open with -> Google Chrome*.
.  Within Chrome, click on the *Print* option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to *Save as PDF*, then click *Save* to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the *src/test/java* folder and choose *Run 'All Tests'*.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose *Run 'ABC'*.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.recipe.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.recipe.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.recipe.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.recipe.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, *UserGuide.html* in *src/main/resources/docs* is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task *processResources*.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. *v0.1*
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Recipe Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested programming tasks to get started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realizes that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devises some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all recipes in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParser.java[`RecipeBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParser.java[`RecipeBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from every entry in the recipe book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from every entry in the recipe book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/RecipeBook.java[`RecipeBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/RecipeBook.java[`RecipeBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/RecipeBook.java[`RecipeBook`] allows you to update a recipe, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/RecipeBook.java[`RecipeBook`]. Loop through each recipe, and remove the `tag` from each recipe.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `RecipeBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/RecipeBook.java[`RecipeBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your recipe book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a recipe, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list because he keeps forgetting the index of the last recipe in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside recipe cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/RecipeCard.java[the `RecipeCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[*DarkTheme.css*] to include some pre-defined colors using CSS, especially if you have experience with web-based CSS.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `RecipeCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/RecipeBookSystemTest.java[`RecipeBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and RecipeBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[StatusBarFooter.fxml] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the recipe book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of recipes when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleRecipeBookChangedEvent(RecipeBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of recipes whenever there are new changes to the Recipe Book.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of recipes status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/RecipeBookSystemTest.java[`RecipeBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of recipes status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the recipe book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the recipe book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the recipe book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupRecipeBook(ReadOnlyRecipeBook)`, so that the recipe book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/RecipeBookStorage.java[`RecipeBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/XmlRecipeBookStorage.java[`XmlRecipeBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for *ReciRecipé*, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular recipe, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each recipe, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a recipe specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first recipe to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first recipe.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

**[Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing.**
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

===== Main:

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParser.java[`RecipeBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

===== Tests:

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParserTest.java[`RecipeBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

**[Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments.**
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

===== Main:

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `_String_` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParser.java[`RecipeBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

===== Tests:

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/logic/parser/RecipeBookParserTest.java[`RecipeBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

**[Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `RecipeCard`.**
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/RecipeCard.java[`RecipeCard`] s to display a remark for each recipe later.

===== Main:

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/RecipeListCard.fxml[RecipeListCard.fxml].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/RecipeCard.java[`RecipeCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

===== Tests:

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/RecipeCardHandle.java[`RecipeCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

**[Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class.**
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`] class. Instead of just using a `_String_`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

===== Main:

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Instruction.java[`Instruction`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `_String_`.

===== Tests:

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

**[Step 5] Model: Modify `_Recipe_` to support a `Remark` field.**
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`].

===== Main:

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the *`add`* and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the recipe will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your *recipeBook.xml* so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

**[Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedRecipe` class.**
We now have `Remark` s for `_Recipe_` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/XmlAdaptedRecipe.java[`XmlAdaptedRecipe`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

===== Main:

. Add a new XML field for `Remark`.

===== Tests:

. Fix *invalidAndValidRecipeRecipeBook.xml*, *typicalRecipesRecipeBook.xml*, *validRecipeBook.xml* etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

**[Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `RecipeBuilder`.**
Since `_Recipe_` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/testutil/RecipeBuilder.java[`RecipeBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/recipe/Recipe.java[`Recipe`].

===== Tests:

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/testutil/RecipeBuilder.java[`RecipeBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the recipe that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `_Recipe_` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/testutil/TypicalRecipes.java[`TypicalRecipes`].

**[Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `RecipeCard`.**
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/RecipeCard.java[`RecipeCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

===== Main:

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/RecipeCard.java[`RecipeCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `_Recipe_` 's remark.

===== Tests:

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/recipe/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysRecipe(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

**[Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic.**
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

===== Main:

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a recipe.

===== Tests:

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
