== Introduction
Flashy -- lightning fast flashcard management.

[TIP]
====
What are flashcards? Traditional flashcards are physical cards, used to aid in memorization.
Each card has two sides: the front contains the question prompt, and the back contains the answer prompt.
====
//tag::overview[]
Flashy is an application to help users organise their flashcards to help them memorise better.
//end::overview[]
Physical flashcards are bulky and hard to search for. They are also difficult to organise. Flashy is the result of our desire to eliminate these challenges that arise from the use of conventional flashcards.
Flashy helps you organise your flashcards with a powerful *tagging* system. Flashy is able to retrieve all flashcards of a given tag in a flash.

As students, we understand that planning out studying sessions is hard. Therefore, we have also built into Flashy an intelligent scheduler, so you can focus on studying, instead of planning your study sessions. Our scheduler uses
*spaced repetition*, which has been shown to be effective for studying.

[NOTE]
`Spaced Repetition` embodies the idea behind the phrase "don't burn the midnight oil". Spreading out study sessions is
shown to be more effective than cramming multiple sessions in a single night.
To learn more, head over to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition

Although Flashy was built for the language learner in mind, it should prove useful for any student, as new studying tool in their arsenal.

Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

.. Put question in `Front` and answer in `Back`.
.. Tag it with something meaningful like `t/Mathematics`
// comment: can we change this
. Use `xref:list[list]` to list all cards
. Select a card with `xref:selectc[selectc] 1` or by clicking on it.
. Answer a card with `xref:answer[answer] c/2`

// comment: want to describe answer and select?

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, there are three different kinds of flashcards:

1. *Normal flashcards*: Normal flashcards are simple question and answer cards with the question being at the front and answer at the back.
2. *Multiple Choice Question flashcards*: Fill-in-the-blanks flashcards are similar to normal flashcards, just that the question has blanks to prompt the users, and the back of the card has answers to the blanks.
3. *Fill-in-the-blanks flashcards*: MCQ flashcards allows you to provide different options as the answer, similar to an MCQ question, and the back will display the correct option.

In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.
Cards can also have multiple tags.

[[Features]]
== Features
Here are some of Flashy's features to help you with your work!

// tag::commandformat[]
=== Reading the Command Format
This section will teach you how to write your own commands to interface with our application.

Let us walk you through the notation with the `addc` command:


```
addc f/FRONT b/BACK [t/TAG]…
```

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply. These are often user-generated content.

[NOTE.example]
====
In `addc f/FRONT`, `FRONT` is a parameter which can be used as `addc f/ What's the best flashcard application? b/Flashy`.
====

* Items in square brackets are optional. In this example, tags are

[NOTE.example]
====
`f/FRONT b/BACK [t/TAG]…` can be used as `f/Am I awesome? b/Yes! t/selfhelp` or as `f/Am I awesome? /Yes!`.
====

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. In this example, multiple tags
can be added to the card.

[NOTE.example]
====
`[t/TAG]…` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/biology`, `t/biology t/midterms2018`.
====

* Parameters can be specified in any order. In this example, `addc f/front b/back` and `addc b/back f/front` are
equivalent.

[[ManagingCards]]
=== Managing Cards

The very first step to using Flashy is to populate Flashy with flashcards.
After which we will proceed to use it to increase your mental capabilities.
This section contains all the information you need to add, select, edit cards and more.

// tag::selectcard[]
[[selectc]]
==== Selecting a flashcard: `selectc`

You can select a card that is currently being listed with the `selectc` command. +
Format: `selectc INDEX`

<<fig:cardIndex>> shows where the index of a card can be found at:

[[fig:cardIndex]]
.Diagram indicating location of the displayed index
image::cardIndex.png[width="350"]

Examples:

* `selectc 2` +
Selects the 2nd card in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st card in the list.

// tag::addcard[]
[[addc]]
==== Adding a flashcard: `addc`

Adds a flashcard to Flashy. The presence of `o/OPTION` parameters will determine whether it is a normal or MCQ-type flashcard. +
Format: `addc f/FRONT b/BACK [t/TAG]…` or +
`addc f/FRONT o/OPTION o/OPTION .. b/BACK [t/TAG]…`

[CAUTION]
Ensure that the parameter for `b/` falls between 1 the number of options inclusive.
[CAUTION]
Ensure that if there are blanks, the parameter for `b/` should have the same number of answers (separated by `,`) as there are blanks.

Examples:

* `addc f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy t/Trivia` +
Adds a normal flashcard with the front and back of the first card being `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, as well as tagging it as `Trivia`.
* `addc f/A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles. b/equal, right` +
Adds a fill-blanks card with the front and back of the card being `A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles.` and `equal, right` respectively. +
Note that a blank is denoted by a single underscore `_`. +
* `addc f/Which continent is Singapore in? o/Asia o/Africa o/Australia o/South America b/1` +
Adds a MCQ-type flashcard with the front being `Which continent is Singapore in?`, options includes `Asia`, `Africa`, `Australia` and `South America` and back being `1`.

[TIP]
A flashcard can have any number of tags (including 0). +
// end::addcard[]

// tag::editcard[]
==== Editing a flashcard : `editc`

Edits an existing flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editc INDEX [f/FRONT] [o/OPTION] .. [b/BACK] [+t/TAG]… [-t/TAG]…`

****
* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
* A particular type of flashcard (normal, MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks) can only be edited to the same type of flashcard (e.g. you cannot edit a normal flashcard to a MCQ flashcard).
* When removing a tag from a flashcard, ensure that the tag exists and the flashcard is associated with that tag.
****

Examples:

* `editc 1 f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy +t/Trivia` +
Edits the front and back of the 1st flashcard to be `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, and also add a Trivia tag to it.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong -t/Trivia` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`, and remove its tag Trivia.
* `editc 1 o/Asia o/Australia o/Africa` +
Edits the options of the 1st flashcard to be `Asia`, `Australia` and `Africa`. (Only if that flashcard is a MCQ flashcard).

[CAUTION]
Ensure that the constraints on flashcard is not violated when editing. For constraints, refer to the *Caution* warning under Section 4.1.1: Adding a flashcard.
// end::editcard[]

// tag::deletecard[]
==== Deleting a flashcard : `deletec`

Deletes the specified flashcard. +

[NOTE]
If a tag no longer has associated flashcards, the tag will also be removed. Don't be alarmed if some of your tags are also removed in the process!

Format: `deletec INDEX`

****
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

`deletec 2` +
Deletes the 2nd flashcard in the list.
// end::deletecard[]

=== Managing Tags

Tags allow you to filter for cards that you want to quicky find that needle in the haystack.
For example you might want to search for cards that are tagged with *Mathematics*, this section can help you with that.

==== Selecting a tag : `select`

Selects the tag identified by the index number. This will show only flashcards with the tag selected. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `select 2` +
Selects the 2nd tag in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st tag in the list.

==== Filtering tags: `find`

Filters the tag list to contain those that match the search terms. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====
The search is case-insensitive, but finds exact partial matches to the tag name.
====

Examples:

* `find biology` will show only tags matching the word `biology`. This will match `Biology`, `biology`, `biOlogy`,
and `Biology Midterms`, but not `bio`, or `chemistry`.

//tag::listcommand[]
==== Clearing filters: `list`

The usage of `list` is 2-fold:

1. `list` allows you to see all your flashcards and tags by clearing all filters.
2. `list` can also be invoked with an additional flag as `list -t`, to list all cards without tags. This allows you to reorganize
otherwise cards that are otherwise inaccessible. +

Format: `list [-t]`

Examples:

* `list` +
Shows all tags and cards.
* `list -t` +
Shows all tags, but shows only cards without tags.
//end::listcommand[]

==== Editing a tag : `edit`

Updates an existing tag to the specified values. +
Format: `edit INDEX n/TAG c/COLOR`

****
* Edits the tag at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the current tag listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Color must be a string of length 6 specifying a link:https://htmlcolorcodes.com/[hex color code]. For example, the color white is represented as `FFFFFF`.
* The existing name of the tag will be replaced with the value that was entered.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 n/French` +
Changes the name of the first tag in the list to `French`.

==== Deleting a Tag: `delete`

Deletes an existing tag. This will remove the tag from all cards that have the tag.

Examples:

* `delete 1` deletes the first visible tag.
* `delete 2` deletes the second visible tag.

// tag::usingflashcards[]
=== Using flashcards
After adding and managing your flashcards, its time to get your A+!
This section will teach you how to let Flashy's intelligent scheduling algorithm prompt you the best time to study!

[[showdue]]
==== Showing a flashcard : `showdue`
To study effectively, you have to know which cards are more worth it to read first.
Luckily Flashy's intelligent scheduler takes care of these things for you.
`showdue` helps you filter out cards that are due by a certain date.

[NOTE]
These dates are usually automatically scheduled by the xref:spacedRepetition[Spaced Repetiton] algorithm. +
You do not have to worry about scheduling yourself as Flashy will do it for you! +
But you could manually do it if you want to, take a look at the xref:schedule[Schedule] command.

Format: `showdue d/DAY m/MONTH y/YEAR`

[TIP]
`showdue` can be used without any options, this will just show the flashcards due by today. +
You can omit some parameters in `showdue`. suppose today is `13/04/2018`,
parameters that you omit would be implicitly assumed to be the current day, month or year.
If you key in `showdue d/28` without typing in `m/04 y/2018`,
the month and year are assumed to be the current month. +
This would show you card due before `28/04/2018`.

Examples:

* `showdue d/28 m/04 y/2018` +
Show cards due before 28/04/2018
* `showdue d/28` +
Suppose today is 13/04/2018, although `m/04 y/2018` is not typed,
they are implicitly assumed to be the current month and year.

[[answer]]
==== Answering flashcards: `answer`
After using `showdue` to show a list of flashcards, you have to select a card to answer.
You can select a card with the xref:selectc[selectc] command.
You can also simply click on the flashcard.

`answer` uses our xref:spacedRepetition[Spaced Repetition] algorithm to intelligently schedule the card to the right time in the future for review.

Format: `answer c/CONFIDENCE_LEVEL`

[IMPORTANT]
CONFIDENCE_LEVEL can only be 0, 1 or 2. +
Card must be selected first before answering.
To learn how to select a card, take a look at xref:selectc[selectc]

===== What does `CONFIDENCE_LEVEL` mean?

* `answer c/0` Again +
I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer c/1` Passable +
I think I know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer c/2` Easy A+ +
Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.

[NOTE]
====
This gives feedback to the scheduler algorithm to automatically schedule the card for review at a time when it thinks you are likely to forget it.

This design is based off the well known forgetting curve, you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve
====

[[schedule]]
==== Show flashcards for review: `Schedule`
Using the `xref:answer[answer]` command to answer a flashcard will automatically schedule the card based on our spaced repetition algorithm.
However, if you want to manually `schedule` a card for review by a certain date, you can do so as well.

Format: `schedule d/DAY m/MONTH y/YEAR`

[IMPORTANT]
Card must be selected first before scheduling.
To learn how to select a card, take a look at xref:selectc[selectc]

[NOTE]
`schedule` can be used without any options, this will just schedule the cards for today. +
You can omit some parameters in `schedule`. suppose today is `13/04/2018`,
parameters that you omit would be implicitly assumed to be the current day, month or year.
If you key in `schedule d/28` without typing in `m/04 y/2018`,
the month and year are assumed to be the current month. +
This would schedule the card for `28/04/2018`.

Examples:

* `schedule d/28 m/04 y/2018` +
Schedule card for 28/04/2018
* `schedule d/28` +
Suppose today is 13/04/2018, although `m/04 y/2018` is not typed,
they are implicitly assumed to be the current month and year.

=== Quality-of-Life features

Flashy has many features to speed up your workflow and make your experience as pain-free as possible.

==== Autocompletion

Instead of memorising the parameters of all the commands, you can instruct Flashy to automatically fill in the relevant parameters for you! After typing a valid command, simply press `TAB` and let Flashy handle the rest.

==== Clearing all data : `clear`

Rather than manually deleting cards and tags, Flashy is able to clear all of its data for you. +
Format: `clear`

[TIP]
This command will instruct Flashy to delete all tags and flashcards. Use this command with caution!

==== Listing entered commands : `history`

If you lose track of the actions you have made at any point in time, you can ask Flashy to list them for you in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
You can also press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows to display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====


==== Undo and Redo
Flashy does not come built in with an eraser. To compensate for that, some commands support undoing and redoing. The commands are `add`, `addc`, `addm`, `edit`, `editc`, `editm`, `delete`, `deletec`, and `clear`.


===== Undoing previous command : `undo`

You can restore the state of Flashy's card bank to its preious state before an _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

===== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Flashy can also revert any `undo` commands made by mistake! +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +

==== Exiting the program : `exit` or `quit`

Once you are confident in acing that exam, don't forget to power down Flashy! When this is done, Flashy will save all changes made to its card bank before gracefully shutting down. +
Format: `exit` or `quit`

// end::qualityoflife[]

=== Managing User Preferences

// tag::changetheme[]
==== Changing the theme : `theme`
Flashy knows that not all study sessions occur during the day. When carrying out all-nighters, remember that you can always switch the theme of Flashy's interface to match the lighting condition of your surroundings! +
Format: `theme t/THEME`

[TIP]
Flashy remembers your most recently used theme and will load it the next time you come back.

Examples:

* `theme t/light`
* `theme t/dark`

// end::changetheme[]
=== Saving the data

All data saved in Flashy's card bank is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Flashy folder.
