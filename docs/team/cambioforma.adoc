== PROJECT: reInsurance

---

== Overview

reInsurance is adapted from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4], a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The application is aimed at insurance agents to provide them with a centralised system to keep track of their clients. It provide a calendar view which allows the user to have a good overview of upcoming appointments with their clients as well as their birthdays to keep in touch. This application also features calculation of commissions earned from clients so as to facilitate the insurance agent in deciding which customer has a higher priority.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added birthday and appointments with a calendar view using Google Calendar API
** What it does: allows the users to keep track of the birthday and appointment dates with clients. The calendar view allows the user to have a good over view of the dates.
** Justification: Allowing the user to record appointments and birthdays are important to the product as these are formation which aids in a centralised management system of clients for an insurance agent. Furthermore, the calendar view allows a good overview which is key when planning for the week or month ahead.
** Highlights: This enhancement includes the use of Google Calendar API which allows for much more future possibilities to integrate with Google. The feature for authentication with Google APIs have been done which would make integrating with other Google APIs in the future easier.
