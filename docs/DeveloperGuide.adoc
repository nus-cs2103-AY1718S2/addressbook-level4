== Introduction
StardyTogether is a command line application which provides students a way to manage their contacts.
It is customized for students in the National University of Singapore (NUS) which allows them to find vacant rooms within NUS and also to track their timetable.
This documentation provides information that will not only help you get started as a StardyTogether contributor, but that you'll find useful to refer to even if you are already an experienced contributor.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B4/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B4/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentUpdated.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[TIP]
Note that although it is stated that contacts are friends in the User Guide (for better presentation), they are actually represented as `Person` class in code.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Undo and Redo Starting Stack
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Undo and Redo Stack after executing one Command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Undo and Redo stack before and after Undo command execution
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Undo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Undo and Redo stack before and after Clear command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Undo and Redo stack before and after List command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Undo and Redo Activity Diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::customizedalias[]
=== Customized Alias feature
==== Current Implementation
The alias mechanism is maintained in a HashMap which resides in `UniqueAliasList` in the Model component. It supports the undoable command.
The alias as specified by the user is used as the key in the HashMap, with its respective command as the value.
Whenever a user enters a command, the application will be able to check if the command is a previously-set alias efficiently by using the API provided by the `UniqueAliasList`.
If the input command word is an existing alias, it will be replaced with its respective command as shown below.
[source,java]
----
public String getCommandFromAlias(String aliasKey) {
    if (aliases.contains(aliasKey)) {
        return aliases.getCommandFromAlias(aliasKey);
    }
    return aliasKey;
}
----

When the user creates a new alias for a command, the `AliasCommand` checks that the command is a valid command, and the alias is not an existing application command word.
The following sequence diagram shows how the `AliasCommand` works:

.Alias Command Sequence Diagram for Logic Component
image::LogicComponentAliasSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How alias list is maintained
.Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The alias list is maintained in a UniqueAliasList which is stored in the Model component.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create an `UniqueAliasList` in the `alias` model
** Pros: Reduce coupling between `Alias` and other commands. This design follows the Open Closed Principle where a command is open to extension and closed to modification.
** Cons: More difficult to implement as need to design an instance of a `UniqueAliasList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a HashMap of `Alias` in each command class
** Pros: Faster to implement as each command class only needs to include a HashMap that stores all the aliases tagged to the command.
** Cons: High coupling between `Alias` and other commands and the HashMaps of every command needs to be iterated through to find to find the aliased command.

===== Aspect: How alias is stored
The following class diagram shows how the aliases are stored:

.Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as `XmlAdaptedAlias` and save to `addressbook.xml`
** Pros: Reduces files where data need to be stored, as all the user saved data is in one file.
** Cons: Need to design a section in `addressbook.xml` for saving alias data with the other data like person data.
* **Alternative 2:** Store in `UserPrefsStorage`
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Affects Import command, to import `UserPrefsStorage` as well, than just importing `addressbook.xml`

===== Aspect: Displaying stored aliases
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the original `list` command to display aliases
** Pros: Utilizes unused `infoPanel` space in the UI.
** Cons: Need to integrate with the `ListCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Modifying `AliasCommand` to support `alias list` command
** Pros: Easier to implement as only modification of the command is required.
** Cons: `alias list` should not be an undoable command, and conflicts with the `AliasCommand`.

// end::customizedalias[]

// tag::mapconsiderations[]
=== Google Maps feature
==== Current Implementation

We are using the Google Maps Browser and passing the location(s) specified by the user into the URL, and then connecting to the internet to retrieve the Google Maps with the respective location(s).
We have implemented two functionalities for the Google Maps: Address locator and locations navigator.

* For one location specified, the "https://www.google.com/maps/search/" URL prefix is used.
* For more than one locations specified, the "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/" URL prefix is used.

When a location specified by the user is an NUS building e.g. `S1`, our application compares the input with the list of NUS buildings to check from, and recognizes it as an NUS building.
The location is replaced with its respective postal code and passed to form the Google Maps URL.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Google Maps implementation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google Maps in browser
** Pros: Does not require a re-setup of project to link with the Google API.
** Cons: Browser mode (Google Lite Maps) does not support some advanced Google Maps features.
(But these additional features are not used in this project and thus having the browser implementation fulfils the intended functionality)
* **Alternative 2:** Use Google Maps API
** Pros: Google Maps in the application will have the complete set of features.
** Cons: May cause a longer loading time for the application and Google Maps browser.

===== Aspect: Saving NUS buildings' addresses
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saving the postal codes of NUS buildings in the Building class
** Pros: Easy to implement. Since there is only one set of fixed NUS buildings and postal codes, both can be stored as lists in the same class.
** Cons: Need to have a method that finds the correct postal code for a building from the lists.
* **Alternative 2:** Creating a new class to store postal codes/addresses of NUS buildings
** Pros: The code looks neater. Every building will have an `Address` class to store their postal codes/addresses.
** Cons: Need to maintain a `Building` list, where each `Building` contains the `Address` class.
// end::mapconsiderations[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
===  Data Encryption
==== Current Implementation

We are using `javax.crypto.cipher` and `java.security.key` package provided by java for the encryption of the data. The `SecurityUtil` class is used to provide the `SHA-1` hashing and `AES` encryption/decryption required.

Using a given password, it is first hashed using `SHA-1` to be used as the `AES` key.
The first 128 bits of the digest created by the `SHA-1` hash is extracted.
This is required as `AES` requires its key to be 128 bits long.

* The encryption can be done simply by using `SecurityUtil.encrypt()` which will encrypt the addressbook.xml.
* The decryption can be done simply by using `SecurityUtil.decrypt()` which will decrypt the addressbook.xml.
* Currently, decryption/encryption is done in `XmlAddressBookStorage` class before/after `readAddressBook` and `saveAddressBook`.

No encryption is done if the user do not set a password.
Users can change their password using the command `encrypt` and decrypt it permanently using the command `decrypt`.

When an 'encrypt' command is issued, the argument is parsed and hashed. Is is then passed to the Model.

.Password Sequence Diagram for Logic Component
image::PasswordSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

The `ModelManager` then updates the password in the `AddressBook` as shown below:

.Password Sequence Diagram for Model Component
image::PasswordSdForModel.png[width="800"]

The 128 bit password used to encrypt `addressbook.xml` is saved in the address book as `XmlAdaptedPassword` to ensure that the password is not lost after every reset of the application.
This is secure as even if a malicious user were to somehow get a copy of the 128 bit password, they would still need to use a computationally unfeasible <<second-pre-image-attack, second pre-image attack>>.
This is because users are unable to input hashed password directly.

When the user first starts the application, `ModelManager` would try to load the data from `addressbook.xml` without using any password.
If `addressbook.xml` is encrypted, this would cause the following code to trigger which would morph the `ui` to `PasswordUiManager` instead of `UiManager`.
[source,java]
----
private void checkPasswordChanged() {
    if (passwordChanged) {
        ui = new PasswordUiManager(storage, model, ui);
    }
}
----
This change would cause the `PasswordWindow` to display instead of the `MainWindow`, requesting for a password input by the user.

.Password Box UI
image::passwordBox.png[width="800"]

If the password the user input is unable to decrypt `addressbook.xml`, a `WrongPasswordEvent` is raised which will cause the `PasswordUiManager` to display the following dialog to the user:

.Wrong Password Dialog UI
image::wrongPasswordDialog.PNG[width="800"]

If the password the user input successfully decrypts `addressbook.xml`, a `CorrectPasswordEvent` is raised. This event is handled by the `PasswordUiManager` which will start the `UiManager`.
The application would behave as if it is not encrypted from here on.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to generate the AES key
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generating the key from a password
** Pros: Users are able to key in their own passwords
** Cons: Users have to input password for their data to be encrypted.
* **Alternative 2:** Generating the key within the code into a file for user to share.
** Pros: It would be guaranteed to be more secure than using our own generated key.
    This is because keys generated by `java.crypto.KeyGenerator` have their algorithms reviewed by many experts in the area.
** Cons: This would require a file to be carried by the user to decrypt their address book which makes it very inconvenient for the user.

===== Aspect: Where to encrypt and decrypt file
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encryption and Decryption done in `XmlAddressBookStorage` class
** Pros: Easy and clear to understand implementation where file is encrypted and decrypted before and after `readAddressBook` and `saveAddressBook`.
** Cons: `addressbook.xml` is in plain text longer than is required.

* **Alternative 2:**  Encryption and Decryption done where needed in `XmlUtil` and `XmlFileStorage`
** Pros: `addressbook.xml` is exposed minimally.
** Cons: Increase coupling of more classes and makes the implementation harder to understand.

===== Aspect: Where to save the password
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save in `addressbook.xml`
** Pros: The password is not lost after every reload of the application.
** Cons: Plaintext of `addressbook.xml` contains the 128 bit `AES` key used.
However, this is still secure as even if a malicious user were to somehow get a copy of the 128 bit password,
they would still need to use a computationally unfeasible <<second-pre-image-attack, second pre-image attack>>.

* **Alternative 2:** Password not saved
** Pros: No chance of password being compromised.
** Cons: Password reset after each reload of application.

===== Aspect: Default Password
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `addressbook.xml` not encrypted by default
** Pros: Users are able to choose whether they want their data to be encrypted or not as encryption and decryption
requires computation which may make the application slower than desired.
** Cons: Unfamiliar users may not be aware of the option of encrypting their data making it less secure.
* **Alternative 2:** Default Password provided to encrypt `addressbook.xml`
** Pros: Data is always encrypted.
** Cons: A default password is, most of the time, as effective as no password and it also slows down the application more than necessary.
// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::datatransfer[]
=== Import StardyTogether file feature
==== Current Implementation

The import StardyTogether mechanism is facilitated by `XmlSerializableAddressBook`, which resides inside `Storage`. It allows the imported XML file to be converted into StardyTogether format.

The imported StardyTogether must be a XML file that follows `XmlAdaptedPerson`, `XmlAdaptedTag`, and `XmlAdaptedAlias` format.

`Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported StardyTogether file that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` in the user's StardyTogether will be added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

.Import Command Sequence Diagram for Model and Storage Component
image::ModelStorageComponentImportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Imported StardyTogether file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the same XML file format as `XmlSerializableAddressBook`
** Pros: Same file format as saved StardyTogether, users can transfer StardyTogether easily without the need to indicate file format.
** Cons: Imported StardyTogether must be in XML file format that follows `XmlAdaptedPerson`, `XmlAdaptedTag`, and `XmlAdaptedAlias` format.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses CSV file format
** Pros: CSV file format is widely used and is able to transfer between different applications (eg. Microsoft Excel).
** Cons: Different file format as saved StardyTogether, implementation of converting file type from XML to CSV is needed.

===== Aspect: How import command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds all `Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported StardyTogether that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` to the user's StardyTogether.
** Pros: User does not need to indicate which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported. Since user can select which `Person` to be exported using `export` command, we assume user has already made his selection.
** Cons: User is not able to select which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.
* **Alternative 2:** Adds selected `Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported StardyTogether that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` to the user's StardyTogether.
** Pros: User is able to select which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.
** Cons: User needs to indicate which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported, which may lead to human errors.

=== Export StardyTogether file feature
==== Current Implementation

The export StardyTogether mechanism is facilitated by `XmlFileStorage`, which resides inside `Storage`. It allows the StardyTogether's `AddressBook` to be converted into a XML file format.

The exported StardyTogether file contains all `Person` in `filteredPersons`, which resides inside `ModelManager`, all `Tag`, and all `Alias` in StardyTogether.

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

.Export Command Sequence Diagram for Model and Storage Component
image::ModelStorageComponentExportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Exported StardyTogether file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the same XML file format as `XmlFileStorage`
** Pros: Same file format as saved StardyTogether, users can transfer StardyTogether easily without the need to indicate file format.
** Cons: Can only be transferred and used by StardyTogether application.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses CSV file format
** Pros: CSV file format is widely used and is able to transfer between different applications (eg. Microsoft Excel).
** Cons: Different file format as saved StardyTogether, implementation of converting file type from XML to CSV is needed.

===== Aspect: How export command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Exports all `Person` in `filteredPersons`, `Tag`, and `Alias` from StardyTogether.
** Pros: User is able to select which `Person` to be exported by using `find` command, user is not able to indicate which `Tag` or `Alias` to be exported. User can exports all `Person` by using `list` command too.
** Cons: User is not able to select which `Tag` or `Alias` to be exported.
* **Alternative 2:** Exports all `Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from StardyTogether.
** Pros: User does not need to indicate which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be exported.
** Cons: User is not able to select which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be exported. This is similar to copying and pasting the saved StardyTogether file using file explorer.

=== Upload StardyTogether file feature
==== Current Implementation

The upload feature involves three steps, requesting for authorization, exporting, and uploading.

1. Redirecting user to a Google URL to request for authorization to his/her Google Drive. User must grant StardyTogether access to his/her Google Drive to continue. If user already granted access, this step will be skipped.
2. Exporting all `Person` in `filteredPersons`, which resides inside `ModelManager`, all `Tag`, and all `Alias` of the StardyTogether to `googledrive` folder in user's computer.
3. Uploading the exported StardyTogether file to user's Google Drive.

Please refer to <<Export StardyTogether file feature,Export StardyTogether file feature>> for implementation on export mechanism.

The upload StardyTogether mechanism is facilitated by using https://developers.google.com/drive/[Google Drive API] in `GoogleDriveStorage`, which resides inside `Storage`. It allows the stored StardyTogether file in user's computer to be uploaded into user's Google Drive.

The uploaded StardyTogether file is the same as exported StardyTogether file stored.

The following sequence diagram shows how the upload operation works:

.Upload Command Sequence Diagram for Model and Storage Component
image::ModelStorageComponentUploadSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Uploaded StardyTogether file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the same XML file format as `XmlFileStorage`
** Pros: Same file format as saved StardyTogether, users can transfer StardyTogether easily without the need to indicate file format.
** Cons: Can only be transferred and used by StardyTogether application.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses CSV file format
** Pros: CSV file format is widely used and is able to transfer between different applications (eg. Microsoft Excel).
** Cons: Different file format as saved StardyTogether, implementation of converting file type from XML to CSV is needed.

=== Birthdays feature
==== Current Implementation
`Birthdays` Command uses the existing `Events` system and sends an event according to the <<parameter, parameters>> provided.

.Birthdays Command Sequence Diagram for Logic Component +
image::LogicComponentBirthdaysSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `BirthdayList` UI component will then receive the event and handle the display of the data +

.Birthdays Command Sequence Diagram for UI Component +
image::UiComponentBirthdayListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

For "birthdays today" notification, the app will create an alert dialog instead.
[source,java]
----
    @Subscribe
    private void handleBirthdayNotificationEvent(BirthdayNotificationEvent event) {
        DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        Alert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.INFORMATION);
        // ... setting up of Alert ...
        alert.showAndWait();
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the `BirthdayList` UI component obtains and parses its data

* **Alternative 1**: Let UI component handle the parsing of UniquePersonList obtained from Event
** Pros: Isolated and independent within `BirthdayList` UI component. Less overhead.
** Cons: Not intuitive to new developers as parsing of data is not expected in UI.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Let `Birthdays` do the parsing of UniquePersonList obtained from Model
** Pros: More modularity.
** Cons: Not apparent in usage by User. Functionality remains the same but Birthdays command becomes more cluttered.

===== Aspect: How User can open Birthday List

* **Alternative 1**: Manual command "birthdays" or "birthdays today"
** Pros: User can control when to view the birthdays.
** Cons: Not very user-friendly. Additional <<parameter, parameter>> cannot be shortened.
* ** Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Notification at the start of app if a birthday is occurring today
** Pros: User can be reminded immediately and need not type the command.
** Cons: Currently, StardyTogether does not have settings to switch on/off the feature. User may find it irritating.

===== Aspect: How User inputs the Birthday <<parameter, parameter>> in `Person` class
* ** Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Fixed format as DDMMYYYY
** Pros: Less room for errors.
** Cons: User may not like the DDMMYYYY format.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Natural Language Processing
** Pros: Users can enter their birthday in their preferred format.
** Cons: External API will be used. May introduce unforeseen bugs.

=== Vacant Room Finder feature
==== Current Implementation
We are using Venue Information JSON file from https://nusmods.com/api/2017-2018/2/venueInformation.json[NUSMods] to retrieve the weekly timetable of the venues. To increase the performance of retrieving the timetable of the venue, we decided to download Venue Information JSON file and have an offline copy stored in our StardyTogether application.

We have added the list of NUS buildings and the list of rooms in each building into the offline copy.

We use `ReadOnlyJsonVenueInformation`, which resides inside `Storage` to read and store the room timetable data inside `nusVenues` in `Room` class, and also store NUS Buildings and their respective rooms inside `nusBuildingsAndRooms` in `Building` class.

To avoid reading the data from Venue Information JSON file whenever the `vacant` command is executed, we only read the data once when the `MainApp` starts.

`ModelManager` will checks if the building is in the list of NUS Buildings, and will throw `BuildingNotFoundException` if the building is not in the list of NUS Buildings.

We have created `Building`, `Room`, `Week`, and `WeekDay` in `Model` to read and store all weekday schedule of all NUS Rooms.

The following architecture diagram shows the model component:

.Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the logic component of Vacant Room Finder works:

.Vacant Command Sequence Diagram for Model Component
image::ModelComponentVacantSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As shown in diagram above, all Rooms weekday schedule will be return in an `ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>` data structure. This result will be shown to the UI on the `InfoPanel`

===== Aspect: Shows list of vacant rooms
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays a list of rooms and the weekday schedule from 0800 to 2100
** Pros: User is able to see which rooms are vacant throughout the day
** Cons: User has to manually find which rooms are vacant at the current time
* **Alternative 2:** Displays a list of vacant rooms at the current time
** Pros: User is able to see which rooms are vacant at current time immediately
** Cons: User is not able to see the room schedule for the whole day

===== Aspect: Design of converting JSON to objects
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a Building, Room, Week and Weekday class
** Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle where each class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software
** Cons: More difficult to implement as the design of the flow of work between classes has to be thought out
* **Alternative 2:** Create a static list of rooms in the Building class which has a room schedule for the day
** Pros: Code is shorter
** Cons: The Room and Building class will have schedule-related code which makes the classes messy.
// end::vacantroomfinder[]

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable feature
==== Current Implementation
When adding a `Person` using the "Add" Command, users can enter their NUSMods shortened link into the "tt/" field.
NUSMods URLs currently come in the format of `.../timetable/SEM_NUM/share?MODULE_CODE=LESSON_CODE`
Using `TimetableParserUtil:parseShortUrl`, we obtain the full url from the shortened link.
Then, we parse the information accordingly and obtain lesson data from {empty}[https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API]] to represent them in `Lesson`
The information is then sorted and added as a list of `Lesson` taken by the user to the Timetable.
[source,java]
----
        try {
            // Grab lesson info from API and store as a map
            URL url = new URL(link);
            @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
            Map<String, Object> mappedJson = mapper.readValue(url, HashMap.class);
            @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
            ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lessonInfo = (ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>)
                    mappedJson.get("Timetable");

            // Parse the information from API and creates an Arraylist of all possible lessons
            ArrayList<Lesson> lessons = new ArrayList<>();
            for (HashMap<String, String> lesson : lessonInfo) {
                Lesson lessonToAdd = new Lesson(moduleCode, lesson.get("ClassNo"), lesson.get("LessonType"),
                        lesson.get("WeekText"), lesson.get("DayText"), lesson.get("StartTime"), lesson.get("EndTime"));
                lessons.add(lessonToAdd);
            }

            return lessons;
        } catch (IOException exception) {
            throw new ParseException("Cannot retrieve module information");
        }
----

The main contents of the timetable is stored as `TimetableData` and is accessed through `Timetable`.
`TimetableData` consists of 2 `TimetableWeek`, which each consist of 5 `TimetableDay`, which each consist of 24
`TimetableSlot` (following the 24h clock)

.Timetable Component
image::TimetableComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In the event the url provided is invalid or empty, a empty `Timetable` will be created.
Do take note that there are dummy urls for the purpose of testing. While normal users should not be able to know of their existence,
entering a dummy link will result in a preset timetable being built.

When the user uses the `TimetableUnionCommand`, the indexes selected will be parsed and a union of the timetables selected will be created.
[source,java]
----
    public static ArrayList<String> unionTimetableDay(ArrayList<TimetableDay> timetables) {
        ArrayList<String> commonTimetable = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean checker;

        for (int i = 8; i < 22; i++) {
            checker = false;
            for (TimetableDay timetable : timetables) {
                TimetableSlot t = timetable.timetableSlots[i];
                if (!t.toString().equals(EMPTY_SLOT_STRING)) {
                    checker = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (checker) {
                commonTimetable.add(TITLE_OCCUPIED);
            } else {
                commonTimetable.add(EMPTY_SLOT_STRING);
            }
        }
        return commonTimetable;
    }
----

Afterwards, it will raise the `TimeTableEvent` which will be caught and handled by the `InfoPanel`.
The `InfoPanel` will swap between `UserDetailsPanel`, `BirthdayList`, `VenueTable` and `TimetableUnionPanel` so that the UI would not be too cluttered.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The use of NUSMods Shortened URLs

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Use NUSMods shortened urls to 'import' the user's timetable over to StardyTogether
** Pros: User-friendly if user already uses NUSMods and knows how to get the shortened link
** Cons: Not helpful to a user who does not use NUSMods. If NUSMods API changes, StardyTogether needs to be updated
* **Alternative 2**: Allow the use of more universal formats such as .ics files
** Pros: More flexibility for the user
** Cons: Hard to implement and parse the input

===== Aspect: Behaviour of the app when data from API is not retrieved successfully

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): A empty timetable is created for them.
** Pros: Prevents unexpected errors
** Cons: Not very intuitive unless user sees the thrown exception
* ** Alternative 2**: Prevent the adding of a Person without a valid timetable
** Pros: Warns the user that the timetable is not inputted properly
** Cons: Not very user-friendly if user just does not have a valid timetable

===== Aspect: Adding of lessons to Timetable

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Users do the adding on NUSMods and re-import the timetable link
** Pros: No need to implement a separate function to add lessons and a separate `Module` class
** Cons: May be troublesome for the user
* **Alternative 2**: Implement a function to add lessons and `Module` class
** Pros: User need not to manually edit the timetable <<parameter, parameter>>
** Cons: Hard to implement. Lessons and modules will not have any usage outside `Timetable`

===== Aspect: Testing of Timetable

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Dummy links (which will never be generated by NUSMods) are used,
 Timetable will parse those differently
** Pros: Allows for easy creation of dummy timetables
** Cons: Although unlikely, user may be able to enter the dummy link as his own timetable (unintended behaviour)
* ** Alternative 2**: Changing value to be non-final, settable with a method
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Violates coding conventions, allows possible unauthorized access to Timetable

===== Aspect: Displaying of Timetable in UI
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Change between the different panels
** Pros: UI would not be too cluttered.
** Cons: User cannot simultaneously use the different panels.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a dedicated spot in the UI for `TimeTablePanel`
** Pros: Easy to refer for users.
** Cons: UI would be confusing and cluttered.

===== Aspect: Size of Timetable size
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Automatically resize according to the size of the Application
** Pros: Size is adaptable to the size of the Application.
** Cons: Variable size may make it confusing for users.
* **Alternative 2:** Fixed Size
** Pros: Easy and predictable size and location of timings.
** Cons: Since display may different from computer to computer, it would be inflexible to use a one size fit all approach.

===== Aspect: Color of Modules in Timetable
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Automatically randomized based on the `hashcode()` of the module name
** Pros: Colors are fixed and more or less randomized.
** Cons: Colors may be same for different modules in the same timetable and Colors are not customizable.
* **Alternative 2:** Pre-defined colors for the different modules
** Pros: No overlap in color and different color for each module
** Cons: Since there are many different modules in NUS, it would be very time-consuming and almost impossible to be implemented.
* **Alternative 3:** User customize colors
** Pros: Customized Application for users.
** Cons: Implementation of this system would be complex and time-consuming, it would be implemented in later versions.
Current implementation is the best in terms of variability and ease of implementation.
// end::timetable[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Auto Complete or Correct feature
==== Proposed Implementation
Currently, some commands such as `add` and `edit` requires many different fills to be filled in for it to work.
This makes it extremely tedious as users have to remember what fills are there to be included.
Spelling mistakes are also very costly as users would need to retype the command.

When the user press the `Tab` key, commands ,and <<parameter, parameters>> carets will auto complete or auto correct.
Pressing `Tab` again would give the next suggested input.

The Auto Correct can be implemented in `CommandBox` as all user inputs can be easily accessed in it.
Editing the text already entered can also be done easily in `CommandBox`.

Since all commands are in the form of `String`, we can use a `TreeSet` of the current input's character to find the closest matching command
and traverse the `TreeSet` to get other suggestions.

To prevent a situation of the need to differentiate between a auto completion of the next <<parameter, parameter>> or getting the next suggestion of the current command or <<parameter, parameter>>,
next suggestion is always chosen before a space is entered and auto completion only happen for non-empty strings.

Suppose that the user wants to type the `encrypt` command, he can press `Tab` to auto complete.

.Auto Completion of Command
image::commandautocomplete.png[width="800"]

If he were to have a spelling error typing `encrytp` instead, the `Tab` key would instead correct it to `encrypt`

.Auto Correction of Command
image::commandautocorrect.png[width="800"]

Now suppose he is trying to add a friend, once he types `p/123` and press `Tab` after the space, `e/` caret will be auto completed for him.

.Auto Completion of Parameter
image::parameterautocomplete.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What is done after user presses `Tab` key
* **Alternative 1 (Suggested):** Automatically completes for the user.
** Pros: Easy and improves efficiency of typing. Familiar for users who uses CLI frequently.
** Cons: Can be confusing as can be auto complete or next suggested input.
* **Alternative 2:** Suggest to user what is expected
** Pros: Does not change the user's current input making it less confusing.
** Cons: Does not really improve the user experience by much.

===== Aspect: Where to implement it
* **Alternative 1 (Suggested):** In `CommandBox`.
** Pros: `CommandBox` has access to the text showing what is already keyed in, making it easy to implement there.
** Cons: `CommandBox` has to do an extra task of determining suggested commands and input, increasing coupling as it would need access to the parser or list of commands.
* **Alternative 2:** In `Parser`
** Pros: Does not increase the coupling of `CommandBox`.
** Cons: Makes changing the current input display a difficult task which may require access to the `CommandBox`.

===== Aspect: What to auto correct or complete
* **Alternative 1 (Suggested):** Commands and <<parameter, Parameters>>.
** Pros: Makes it easy for users as everything can be auto completed or corrected.
** Cons: Makes it more confusing as sometimes it completes commands while other times it completes the <<parameter, parameters>>.
Also makes the implementation complicated as a clear distinction of Command and <<parameter, Parameters>> have to be made for completion and correction.
* **Alternative 2:** Only Commands or <<parameter, Parameters>>
** Pros: Easier to understand.
** Cons: Not as efficient for the user.

// end::autocomplete[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
