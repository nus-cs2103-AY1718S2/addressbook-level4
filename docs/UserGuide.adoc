== Introduction

*Your TA* is for university teaching assistants who prefer to use a desktop application to manage student contacts and plan your schedule.
More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
If you can type fast, it can get your contact management and tasks scheduling done faster than traditional GUI applications. +

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `YourTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in Figure 1 below.
+
.The GUI upon Starting Up.

+
.  The command box is where you type in commands followed by pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window for the application.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts.
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the application.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Contact Features

====
*Command Format*

* There are some equivalent shortcut commands known as aliases with fewer alphabetic letters or a sign. +
e.g. to add a person to the addressbook, you can type 'add n/John Doe', 'a n/John Doe' or '+ n/John Doe'.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero). +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, or even not used at all.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
