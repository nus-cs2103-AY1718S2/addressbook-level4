== PROJECT: TuitionCor

---

== Overview

TuitionCor is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing client information*. More importantly, TuitionCor is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuitionCor can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *close, restore and switch command*
** What it does:
*** Close command enables user to be able to close a client which is either a student and tutor. The closed client will be stored and displayed in a closed client list.
*** Restore command enables user to restore a previously closed client from the closed client list. The restored client will now be stored and displayed in active client list.
*** Switch command allows user to toggle between active client list and closed client list.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because after a client is successfully assigned by the user, the client can be closed instead of deleting. This allows the user to maintain an organised and updated active client list containing unassigned clients only. Furthermore, information of past assigned clients can also be retrieved conveniently from the closed clients list if required. Clients can also be restored in an event that they become active again.
** Highlights: This enhancement paves the foundation for further enhancement to TuitionCor.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a sort commands to allow sorting by name, subject, grade and location*
