== Intro

Welcome to contactHeRo developer guide! This guide contains all the information you need to quickly get started in contributing to contactHeRo.

If you notice any mistakes or if there is any missing vital information then please let us know via contactHeRo@gmail.com. +
Let's get started!
// end::intro[]

== Setting up

Before you start contributing to contactHeRo, let us help you to set up.

=== Setting up your environment
Given below is the required environment for you to start contributing.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
[TIP]
Not sure how to install Java? Visit the oracle website link below for more information. https://tinyurl.com/yb8leqv8
*JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
You can follow the steps below to set up contactHeRo in your computer.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup
You can double check whether your setup is right or not by following the steps below.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

Last thing before you start to develop contactHeRo, do some configuration to ensure the code is consistent.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

=== Getting started with coding

Now you are ready to start coding. +
    Here are some tips to get started with contributing to contactHeRo:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

Thanks for joining us in contributing to contactHeRo! Have fun!

== Design

This section helps you understand the overall design of contactHeRo.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="800", align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800", align="center"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when contactHeRo data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800", align="center"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800", align="center"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores contactHeRo data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save contactHeRo data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
Given below is the implementation detail of the Undo/Redo feature and some alternative design considerations.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of contactHeRo (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of contactHeRo before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in contactHeRo. The current state of contactHeRo is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore contactHeRo to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores contactHeRo to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire contactHeRo.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies contactHeRo (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]


// tag::details[]
=== Details Panel Implementation
Given below is the implementation detail of the Details Panel and some alternative design considerations.

==== Current Implementation

`DetailsPanel` is a TabPane which consists of the following tabs:
// tag::tabs[]
****
* `Contact Details`
* `LinkedIn Search`
* `Calendar`
* `Draft Email`
* `Google`
****
// end::tabs[]

The `select` command shows the contact details of the person at the specified index under the `Contact Details` tab.
The `ContactDetailsDisplay` is a GridPane embedded in the `Contact Details` tab and the UML diagram below represents the UI structure for the `ContactDetailsPanel` (Refer to Figure 30):

.UML Diagram for DetailsPanel UI
image::DetailsPanelClassDiagram.png[width="600", align="center"]

The `DetailsPanel` also comes into play when the user manually clicks on the `PersonCard` and the panel corresponding `Contact Details` or `LinkedIn` is currently shown. This is implemented by handling the `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` in both the `ContactDetailsPanel` and the `BrowserPanel`.

[NOTE]
Both the `select` and `linkedIn` command function quite similarly and only differ in the tabs that they trigger.

The figure below (Refer to figure 31) is the wireframe for the `ContactDetailsDisplay`:

.Wireframe for Contact Details Panel.
image::ContactDetailsDisplayWireFrame.png[width="600", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Improving the UI +


**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show the extra details of contact after they are selected. +
**Pros**: Allows more readability of the contact details and since other attributes like `Current Position` and `Company` have been added to the `Person` class, too much information would make the `PersonCard` cluttered. +
**Cons**: User needs to manually select the user to see the contact details of that person. +

**Alternative 2:** Show  the contact details of the person only in the `PersonCard`. +
**Pros**: User only has to look in the `PersonCard` for any and every detail +
**Cons**: Looks very cluttered and has poor User Interface design.

**Alternative 3 :** Show all the tabs as completely independent windows. +
**Pros**: Completely isolates the UI for different commands like `select` and `linkedIn` and provides more focus. +
**Cons**: In the current implementation one window is easily accessible from another, just by manually switching tabs which would not be possible with this alternative since the user would have to run many different commands to do this.
//end::details[]

// tag::tabSwitch[]
=== Tab Switching Mechanism
Given below is the implementation detail of the Tab Switching Mechanism and some alternative design considerations.

==== Current Implementation
Tab Switching Mechanism is an event driven mechanism.

.Component interaction for Tab Switching Mechanism.
image::SwitchTabRequestEventHighSD.png[width="800", align="center"]

The above diagram (Refer to Figure 13) shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the tab switching mechanism. We use the event, `SwitchTabRequestEvent` which sets the current tab in the `DetailsPanel` to one of five tabs below depending on the input command.
include::DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tabs]

The code for the `SwitchTabRequestEvent` event is as follows.

[source, java]
----
public class SwitchTabRequestEvent extends BaseEvent {
    public final int tabId;
    public SwitchTabRequestEvent(int tabId) {
        this.tabId = tabId;
    }
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
The `SwitchTabRequestEvent` has an integer attribute `tabId`. The event handlers use this `tabId` to switch between tabs wherein the tabs `Contact Details`, `LinkedIn Search`, `Calendar`, `Draft Email` and `Google`have tabIds 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Let us look at an execution example for the LinkedIn Command.

.Sequence diagram for the event posting for the Tab Switching Mechanism.
image::SwitchTabRequestEventSD.png[width="800", align="center"]

As seen from the sequence diagram above (Refer to Figure 14), when the user types the `linkedIn` command, an instance of LinkedInCommand would be created and upon execution by LogicManager, the event SwitchTabRequestEvent would be posted by the EventCenter to the EventBus:

[source, java]
----
public class LinkedInCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        //... other execution statements
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwitchTabRequestEvent(TAB_ID_LINKEDIN));
        //... other execution statements
    }
    ...
----

`DetailsPanel` class in the `UI` component has the `handleSwitchTabRequestEvent()` method which listens for the event. Upon receiving the event, it switches the tab depending on the `tabId` passed to the event.

[source, java]
----
public class DetailsPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleSwitchTabRequestEvent(SwitchTabRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        tabPane.getSelectionModel().clearAndSelect(event.tabId);
    }
    ...
----

Shown below is the sequence diagram for the above implementation (Refer to figure 15).

.Sequence diagram for the event handling for the Tab Switching Mechanism.
image::SwitchTabRequestEventSD2.png[width="350", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation +


**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use event driven mechanism. +
**Pros**: Event is only handled in the `DetailsPanel` and not in the Command itself hence decreasing coupling between the UI and Logic. +
**Cons**: Tab switching is a hidden mechanism and might not be intuitive to certain users.

**Alternative 2:** Switch tab in the command execution itself. +
**Pros**: . +
**Cons**: The `TabPane` will have to be accessible to the logic which will increase coupling.

// end::tabSwitch[]

// tag::jobs[]
=== Job Openings Implementation
Given below is the implementation detail of the Job Openings feature and some alternative design considerations.

==== Current Implementation

The `Job` object represents a job opening in contactHeRo. It contains `Position`, `Team`, `Location` and `NumberOfPositions` objects and a set of `Skills`, which represent the position, team, location, the number of available positions and the required skills  for the job opening respectively (Refer to Figure 12).

[NOTE]
All fields mentioned above are compulsory for the `Job` object unlike the `Person` where `skill` is optional.

.UML class diagram for Job Opening
image::JobUML.png[width="600", align="center"]

In addition to the above attributes, the `Job` object also contains a set of `Skills` which denote the skills required for the job opening.

`Job` objects are kept in-memory during the running of contactHeRo. A `UniqueJobList` is maintained which contains the Job (Refer to Figure 13) and assures that there are no duplicate `Job` objects. The `UniqueJobList` object is then kept and used by ModelManager to carry out commands related to job openings.

.Model management of Job objects
image::JobModelUML.png[width="600", align="center"]

The storage of job openings is very similar to that of the persons. `Job` objects are stored in a XML storage file in a JAXB-friendly version `XmlAdaptedJob`. When the program starts, `XmlAdaptedJob` objects are read in as jobs in the `XmlSerializableAddressBook` via `XmlFileStorage`.

The job openings management is facilitated by several command classes in contactHeRo, namely:
****
* JobAddCommand
* JobEditCommand
* JobDeleteCommand
* JobFindCommand
* JobListCommand
* JobMatchCommand
****

The implementation of these commands is quite similar to the equivalent operations in the `Person` class. Let us look at `JobAddCommand` as an example.

*Adding Job Openings*

Adding job openings is facilitated by the JobAddCommand. Execution of this command adds a `Job` Object to contactHeRo with the input `Position`, `Team`, `Location`, `NumberOfPositions` and `Skills`.

Given below is the sequence diagram for addition of a job opening.

.High Level Sequence Diagram for adding a job opening
image::SDforAddJobEventHandling.png[width="800", align="center"]

The following snippet shows how the executeUndoableCommand() method updates the model of the application by adding the job to the list of jobs.

[source, java]
----
public class JobAddCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            model.addJob(toAdd);
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
        } catch (DuplicateJobException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_JOB);
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

The job openings are displayed towards the right side of the UI in the `JobListPanel`.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing job openings +


**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same file to store jobs and persons. +
**Pros**: Certain jobs and persons may have the same skills and in the current implementation there will not be any duplicates in the data file, thus saving memory. +
**Cons**: Different types of data in the same file.

**Alternative 2:** Use different files to store jobs and persons. +
**Pros**: Data is segregated by type. +
**Cons**: Certain jobs and persons may have the same skills and in this implementation, there might be duplicate skills having one copy in each file.

=== Matching jobs mechanism

The `JobMatchCommand` uses `PersonSkillContainsKeywordsPredicate` to match person's skills with a job's skills. It accepts the index for the job to match and then uses the `PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` to match the job. Below is the code for the execution of the `JobMatchCommand`:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    ...
    Job jobToMatch = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

    model.updateFilteredPersonList(new PersonSkillContainsKeywordsPredicate(
            CollectionUtil.getSetAsStringList(jobToMatch.getSkills())));
    // return result
}
----

`PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` takes in the list of skills of the job as the keywords as the parameter and then checks if the person has any of these skills using the `SkillUtil`. The code for matching the skills is as follows:

[source, java]
----
/**
 * Checks if a set of skills contains any of the {@code keywords}.
 */
public static boolean match(List<String> keywords, Set<Skill> list) {
    String skillList = getSkillsAsString(list);
    return keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(skillList, keyword));
}
----

[NOTE]
To minimize code duplication, we made a utility class `SkillUtil` which is used both by `PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` during execution of `matchjob` and `find s/` commands and `JobSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` during the execution of `findjob s/` command.
// end::jobs[]

// tag::autoComplete[]
=== Auto-complete Mechanism

The auto-complete mechanism is implemented in the `CommandBox` in the `UI` component. We check the key pressed by the user and if it is the `Tab` key, the auto-complete mechanism is triggered.

Given below is are the activity diagram (Refer to figurue 20) for the mechanism.

.UML class diagram for Job Opening
image::Auto-CompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

The `previous input` and `tab Counter` are recorded to account for cases where more than one command share the same
prefix. For e.g. the `add`, `addjob` and `addapp` commands share the common `add`. In such a case, the user can just
type `a` or `ad` or `add` and press `Tab` multiple times to cycle between these commands which will keep incrementing
the Tab counter, `tabNumber` in a cyclic manner.

// end::autoComplete[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::profilepicture[]
=== Profile Picture Feature
Profile picture feature allows the user to show persons' profile pictures.

[NOTE]
`ProfilePicture` refers to the class `ProfilePicture`. +
"Profile picture" refers to the image file which is used as the profile picture.

==== Current implementation

===== Input and store profile picture path:
`ProfilePicture` is a `Person` 's optional attribute. It receives profile picture path providing by users. +
It resides inside `model`, but also works with `ui`.

`ProfilePicture` is updated by either command `add` or `edit` typed by the user.
As the user will input `ProfilePicture`, it is necessary to ensure that the input is valid.
This has been done by two methods:

* **`hasValidProfilePicture`:** Check if the path is valid and exist.
* **`isValidProfilePicture`:** Check if the path leads to an image file.

These are the two methods:
[source, java]
----
    public static boolean hasValidProfilePicture(String profilePicture) {
        File file = new File(profilePicture);
        return file.exists() && !file.isDirectory();
    }
----

[source, java]
----
    public static boolean isValidProfilePicture(String test) {
        return test.matches(PROFILE_PICTURE_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----



This is the validation regrex for your reference:
[source, java]
----
public static final String PROFILE_PICTURE_VALIDATION_REGEX = "^$|(.+(\\.(?i)(jpeg|jpg|png|gif|bmp))$)";
----

===== Copy and store profile picture:

After the user has input a valid `ProfilePicture`, contactHeRo will copy profile picture and store it in a `Profile Picture` folder, which resides in the same folder of app. +
If this folder doesn't exist, it will be created when the app is starting. This has been done due to method `createProfilePicturesFolder` in `StorageManager`.
[source, java]
----
private void createProfilePicturesFolder() {
        File dir = new File("./ProfilePictures");
        dir.mkdir();
    }
----

Choosing a name for the copied profile picture so that it will not be duplicate is crucial when copying profile picture.
ContactHeRo deals with this by naming copied profile pictures by the date and time that it was created. Hence, there will not be any duplicates. +
This is how it has been done:
[source, java]
----
private String copyImageToProfilePictureFolder(String profilePicture) {
        String destPath = "";
        try {
            File source = new File(profilePicture);
            String fileExtension = extractFileExtension(profilePicture);
            Date date = new Date();
            destPath = PROFILE_PICTURE_FOLDER.concat(
                    date.toString().replace(":", "").replace(" ", "").concat(
                            ".").concat(fileExtension));
            File dest = new File(destPath);
            Files.copy(source.toPath(), dest.toPath());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Exception will not happen as the profile picture path has been check through hasValidProfilePicture
        }
        return destPath;
    }
----

===== Show profile picture:

Profile pictures are shown in two places: `ContactDetailsDisplay` and `PersonCard` (both these views belong to `ui`).

`Profile Picture` has method `getImage` to return profile picture in form of `Image`. +
Hence, it is shown by calling this method to provide `Image` for `ImageView` of both views. +

If provide picture is not provided, `ContactDetailsDisplay` and `PersonCard` will show the default profile picture.
This is a code snippet of `ContactDetailsDisplay` dealing with profile picture feature:
[source, java]
----
if (person.getProfilePicture().filePath != null) {
            imageView.setImage(person.getProfilePicture().getImage());
        } else {
            imageView.setImage(getImage(DEFAULT_IMAGE));
        }
----
[TIP]
Don't know Image and ImageView. Check these two links: +
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/image/ImageView.html +
https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/image/Image.html


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to link profile picture with `ProfilePicture`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Takes in the image path ,copy the image to the ProfilePictureFolder and store the copied image's path.
** Pros: We still have profile picture if the original profile picture is lost.
** Cons: Memory consumption.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the image path and retrieve the image from the path when necessary.
** Pros: Less memory consumption.
** Cons: Original Image may be lost.
// end::profilepicture[]
// tag::email[]

=== Emailing a contact using Google API

==== Current implementation
The sending of email will be implemented using the Google API.

Firstly, to access the Google API, the user must login to Google using the `googlelogin` command.
The `GoogleLoginCommand` class will open the Google authentication webpage in the built-in web browser for user to login.

The `GoogleAuthentication` class will handle the authentication process of Google login.
After authentication is successful, the user will be redirected to the Google homepage,
where the `Token` is stored in the URL.

Below is the sequence diagram of the `googlelogin` command:

.Sequence Diagram of the GoogleLoginCommand
image::GoogleLoginSequence.png[width="600", align="center"]

Next, a `GmailClient` is created using the `GoogleAuthentication` class and `Token`.
The `Token` is obtained from the redirected URL, meaning that the user must not navigate to other URL
after they have logged in.

Below is the class diagram of the `GmailClient`:

.Class Diagram of GmailClient and GoogleAuthentication
image::GmailClassDiagram.png[width="600", align="center"]

This newly created `GmailClient` class will provide all the services that use the Google API.

Now that the `GmailClient` is created, we can use it send out emails!

The user will use the `email` command to start this process.
The `EmailCommand` class will open an email interface to send email to the chosen contact. `EmailCommand` extends the `Command` class. It takes in an index and also an optional field `EMAILSUBJECT` through the `EmailCommandParser`,
similar to the implementation of `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`.

The `EmailPanel` is the UI for user to draft their email. The UI has 3 inputs, *To*, *Subject* and *Body*. *From* is not needed here as we already have
the authorised user's email address in `GoogleAuthentication`.

The `GmailMessage` class will take in the values input by the user
in the UI. These values will be stored in `GmailMessage`
and packaged into a `MimeMessage` ready to be send out.
[source, java]
public static MimeMessage createEmailContent(String to, String from, String subject, String bodyText) throws MessagingException {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);
        MimeMessage emailContent = new MimeMessage(session);
        emailContent.setFrom(new InternetAddress(from));
        emailContent.addRecipient(javax.mail.Message.RecipientType.TO, new InternetAddress(to));
        emailContent.setSubject(subject);
        emailContent.setContent(bodyText, "text/html; charset=utf-8");
        return emailContent;
    }

Finally, `GmailClient` will send out the `MimeMessage` of `GmailMessage` as an email.
[source, java]
public static void sendEmail(MimeMessage emailContent) throws MessagingException, IOException {
        Message message = createMessageWithEmail(emailContent);
        message = service.users().messages().send("me", message).execute();
    }

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to login to Google
* Alternative 1: Using `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` to log in.
** Pros: Very simple to implement and handle. `Token` and `Credential` are handled by the API.
** Cons: It opens a default web browser, which the users are able to close. `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` will stall the
main thread in order to wait for the user to authenticate, if the user close the browser, the app will crash.
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Using a built-in web browser to get the `Token` from the URL.
** Pros: User cannot close the built in browser. The authentication process will not stall the main thread.
** Cons: If the user changes the URL in the web browser, the `Token` is gone and the user have to re-login.

===== Aspect: How to send an email
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Using Gmail API to send an email.
** Pros: Able to customize the UI that the user will use to send out an email.
** Cons: Will take more time to implement due to additional UI components.
* Alternative 2: Using `Webview` to display the Gmail drafting url.
** Pros: Faster implementation as similar feature has been done before.
** Cons: Not customizable and text may appear small in `Webview`.

// end::email[]

// tag::loginsystem[]
=== Login System Implementation

==== Current Implementation

The login system is currently implemented such that there is only one user per application. Logging in and out of contactHeRo is done in the same way as the other commmands which is through the command line.

==== Logging in

When the user starts the application, the user will see the display screen. The user will need to login in order to switch to the main display to view the data.
Most of the commands will be locked so as to prevent modification of the data in contactHeRo before a user logs in. The commands that are available for use are `LoginCommand`, `HelpCommand`, `ClearHistoryCommand` and `ExitCommand`.

The user will need to enter the `login` command to log in before he can get to the main window. The image below shows
the sequence diagram for the `login` command in the logic component.

.Logic Component Sequence Diagram for logging in
image::LoginSDLogicComponent.png[width="800", align="center"]

As seen in the image, when the user logs in, an instance of `LogicCommand` is created which then makes a function call to `Model` to check the validity of the inputs. Afterwards, the `LogicCommand` instance will post a `LoginEvent` to \
`EventsCenter` and the event will be handled by the `UI` component to switch the display.

==== Logging out

When the user is done with using the application, the user can use the `LogoutCommand` to log out. Once the log out is entered, the user will be brought back to the display screen.

==== Customizing username and password

Currently, a default username and password is given for first time users of contactHeRo. This information can be seen in the in the `ResultDisplayPanel` in the display window when the user starts up the application. See the image below.

.LoginScreen.png
image::LoginPrompt.png[width="800", align="center"]

Users can change the username and password by using the `updateusername` command and `updatepassword` command respectively.

[TIP]
Constraints are set to both username and password to prevent illegal values from being used, such as an empty string. The code snippets for the regex of both username and password are shown below.

[source, java]
public static final String USERNAME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "\\S\\w{3,20}";

[source, java]
public static final String PASSWORD_VALIDATION_REGEX = "(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\\d)[\\p{Alnum}](\\S{4,20})";

==== Storing of user account

In our implementation, the `Account` class in the `model` component stores the in-memory data for the username and password. The `AccountsManager` class handles the methods which interacts with the data in `Account`, such as login and update password.

For storing of the user account data in hard disk, it is handled by the `XmlAccountData` class in the `storage` component. The data will be stored as an XML file in a JAXB-friendly version `XmlAdaptedAccount`. This data file is a separate file from the file which stores the main data of contactHeRo.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of user account data +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores user account data in a separate file.+
**Pros**: User can still retrieve their data if they forget their customize username or password by simply removing the file storing account data and logging in with their default username and password. +
**Cons**: Data is not very secure as everyone can access the data through the default username and password. +

**Alternative 2:** Stores user account data in the same file with the main data. +
**Pros**: Resolves problem of accessing data from default account. +
**Cons**: Data in contactHeRo becomes lost if user forgets the customized username or password. +

**Aspect:** How login UI is implemented +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same window for the display screen and main screen. +
**Pros**: Faster to implement as layout is similar to main screen. Also reduces code duplication. +
**Cons**: Can only do small changes to layout for display screen. +

**Alternative 2:** Create a separate login window. +
**Pros**: Login UI can be customized to make it more user friendly for users visually. +
**Cons**: User do not have to deal with the opening and closing of windows which may slow the app. +

=== Matching jobs implementation

==== Current Implementation

The `JobMatchCommand` uses `PersonSkillContainsKeywordsPredicate` to match person's skills with a job's skills. It accepts the index for the job to match and then uses the `PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` to match the job. Below is the code for the execution of the `JobMatchCommand`:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    ...
    Job jobToMatch = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

    model.updateFilteredPersonList(new PersonSkillContainsKeywordsPredicate(
            CollectionUtil.getSetAsStringList(jobToMatch.getSkills())));
    // return result
}
----

`PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` takes in the list of skills of the job as the keywords as the parameter and then checks if the person has any of these skills using the `SkillUtil`. The code for matching the skills is as follows:

[source, java]
----
/**
 * Checks if a set of skills contains any of the {@code keywords}.
 */
public static boolean match(List<String> keywords, Set<Skill> list) {
    String skillList = getSkillsAsString(list);
    return keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(skillList, keyword));
}
----

[NOTE]
To minimize code duplication, we made a utility class `SkillUtil` which is used both by `PersonSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` during execution of `matchjob` and `find s/` commands and `JobSkillMatchesKeywordsPredicate` during the execution of `findjob s/` command.
// end::loginsystem[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
This section shows you how to test contactHeRo
.
=== Running Tests

There are three ways for you to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, contactHeRo depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in contactHeRo, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your contactHeRo application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.
*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your contactHeRo application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving contactHeRo to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves contactHeRo after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for contactHeRo storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that contactHeRo can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.
**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

// tag::product[]
*Target users:*

The application is targeted towards Human Resources Managers at companies, especially those responsible for recruitment. Such recruiters have a lot of contacts to +
manage which include contact details and profiles of potential employees, job openings and appointments. +
It is essential for them to have a quick and easy access to these contacts. Hence, contactHero aims to make their lives easier by helping them to store and manage their contacts efficiently.
// end::product[]

*User Profile*:

* Recruiters who have a significant number of contacts and job openings to manage
* Recruiters who prefer desktop apps
* Recruiters who are good at typing and hence prefer CLI apps

*Value proposition*: An ideal solution for small teams and business professionals who need a simple solution to manage their contacts and help them with day-to-day business activities.

*Feature contributions:*

1. Kushagra Goyal
 * Major Feature: Job Openings
 ** Users can add job openings.
 ** Users can edit job openings.
 ** Users can delete job openings.
 ** Users can match job openings to potential employees.

 * Minor Feature: Contact details and LinkedIn search display.
 ** Users can view the contact details in a separate panel using the `select` command.
 ** Users can view the LinkedIn search of the person using the `linkedIn` command.

 * How do these features fit into the product scope?
 ** Major Feature: A recruiter needs the list of the job openings in the company so he knows what are the current job openings and what tagsets to look for in people. This way, the user can better search for potential employees.
 ** Major Feature: A recruiter needs the list of the job openings in the company so he knows what are the current job openings and what tagsets to look for in people. This way, the user can better search for potential employees.
 ** Minor Feature: Viewing the contact details in a separate focused panel makes them easier to read for the user as the Person card can now just contain limited information like the person's name, current position and company, also allowing more number of contacts to be displayed at a time since amount of information is reduced. Moreover, recruiters need to keep a track of the professional progress of his/her potential recruits and having easy access to their LinkedIn profiles will help them do this efficiently.

2. Do Andre Khoi Nguyen
 * Major Feature: Calendar
 ** Users can view calendar in different views.
 ** Users can add events to the calendar.
 ** Users can delete events from the calendar.

 * Minor Feature: Profile Picture display.
 ** Users can add a profile picture by using `add` command or `edit` command.
 ** Users can view the profile picture.

 * How do these features fit into the product scope?
 ** Major Feature: Recruiters have a lot of appointments, meetings, and interviews to manage. Hence, having a calendar where they can view, add, delete appointment will help them visualize and manage their time more effectively.
 ** Minor Feature: Recruiters need to work with thousand of employee. Hence, remember name and details is really hard. By viewing profile pictures of the potential employees, recruiters can recognize them easier.

3. Kevin Chin
* Major Feature: Email contact
** User can use the "email" command to send email to chosen contact.
** The feature uses Gmail API to send emails.

* Minor Feature: Find contact by tag
* Minor Feature: Find contact by tag
** User can find contact by tag using keyword of the tag.
** User can find contact by tag using keyword of the tag.
** User can find contact by tag using keyword of the tag.
** Supports multiple keywords.

* How do these features fit into the product scope?
** Major Feature: Recruiters may sometimes need to set up appointments, meetings, and interviews. This will usually be done through the use of email. This feature will be convenient for them as the email address of the contacts are already in contactHeRo.
** Minor Feature: Sometimes, recruiter might not remember the name of the person they wish to contact. The assigned role of a person is much easier to remember. Therefore, this feature is very useful in helping them find a contact easily.

4. Jason Lim
* Major Feature: Login System
** Users can be assured that their data in contactHeRo is secured.
** User can create a new account to login to contactHeRo.
** User can login and logout of contactHeRo through CLI.

* Minor Feature: Clear list of history
** User can clear away the list of commands which they have entered in previously using the `clearhistory` command.

* How do this features fit into the product scope?
** Major Feature: Recruiters are dealing with data of their potential employees and some of these data are personal and sensitive. Recruiters may also have some confidential company data stored in the application. Hence it is necessary for them to set up some form of security to protect these sensitive data. Having a login system is one of the common methods to ensure data security.

** Minor Feature: As our application is mainly using CLI, sometimes the commands we entered may contain sensitive information. For example, the `add` command contains the phone number, address and email of the person being added into the application. All of the inputs entered into the command line can be viewed by using the history command. Hence being able to clear away the history of user inputs can help to protect those sensitive information. In addition, clearing away the back log help save space in the application.
