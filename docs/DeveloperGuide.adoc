By: `Team F14-B4`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

=== What is Bibliotek
Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast, and easy to use. It is targeted at heavy readers who require a hassle-free way of managing and keep tracking of their read and unread books.

=== Core team
Bibliotek was developed and is maintained by https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F14-B4[Team F14-B4]. Feel free to https://f14-b4.netlify.com/contactus[contact us] for any enquries.

=== Contributing
Bibliotek is an open source project and contributors are always welcome. To get involved, start by reading <<Setting-Up>>.

[[Setting-Up]]
== Setting up

This section includes the instructions to set up your development environment.

=== Prerequisites

Prior to setting up the project proper, make sure you have the following.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can get the latest Java 8 JDK at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[this link].
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

To setup the project in IntelliJ, follow the steps below.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

To verify that the setup is completed successfully, you should:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

This subsection includes configurations that you may find necessary or useful as you work on this project. We recommend that you make these configuration changes and additions before you start writing code.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. Follow the instructions below to rectify this.

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section documents the design and interaction of components in Bibliotek. Please take a moment to understand the different components before making any code changes.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The *_Architecture Diagram_* in Figure 1 explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. Its responsibilities are as follows.

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components. These components and a brief summary of their responsibilities are given below.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Network,*`Network`*>>: Makes web API calls to online services.

Each of the five components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.
The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 2 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Logic` component.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ in Figure 3 shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteBook.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `BookShelfChangedEvent` when the `BookShelf` data is changed, instead of asking `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteBookEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 5 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Ui` component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BookDetailsPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `Ui` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The key functionalities of the `Ui` component are:

* Executing user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binding itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responding to events raised from various parts of the App and updating the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 6 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Logic` component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Logic` component is home to various classes which extends `Command`. These classes represent supported commands that may or may not be undoable.
The structural relationship between `Command` and `UndoableCommand` is shown in Figure 7 below.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

NOTE: An `UndoableCommand` is a command that makes changes to the book shelf data.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The following is the general workflow when the user enters some input.

.  `Logic` uses the `BookShelfParser` class to parse the user input.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book), make web API calls using the `Network`, and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

The _Sequence Diagram_ in Figure 8 shows the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteBookSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 9 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `BookShelf` data.
* stores the user added aliases.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 10 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `BookShelf` data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the recently selected books data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the `UniqueAliasList` data in xml format and read it back.
* does not depend on any of the other four components.

[[Design-Network]]
=== Network component

The _Class Diagram_ in Figure 11 shows the interaction between different classes in the `Network` component.

.Structure of the Network Component
image::NetworkClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/network/Network.java[`Network.java`]

The `Network` component:

* can make asynchronous web API calls to Google Books API.
* can make asynchronous web API calls to NLB catalogue.
* does not depend on any of the other four components.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package. This includes event and utility classes.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::search1[]
=== Search feature

The search feature allows the user to search for books on https://books.google.com/[Google Books, window="_blank"] that matches some user-specified parameters.
This allows the user to easily search for particular books, and to add them without having to enter all the information manually (using the `add` command).

==== Current Implementation

[[Search-Network]]
===== Network component
// end::search1[]

As part of the implementation of the search feature, the network component was added to allow for communicating with online services.
An overview of the network component can be found in <<Design-Network>>.

// tag::search2[]
The `Network` object is passed by `LogicManager` into each `Command`, and is available for use by default, without the need for the `Command` to override `setData`.

The `Network` API exposes various methods for making web API calls to various endpoints.
Apart from those, it also provides a `stop` method that allows for graceful shutdown of the internal asynchronous HTTP client.

As an example, if a command needs to retrieve search results from https://developers.google.com/books/[Google Books API, window="_blank"], it can make a call to the `searchBooks` method of the `Network` API.
The following sequence diagram shows what happens when `searchBooks` is called:

image::SearchBooksSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The methods shown above are asynchronous - they will not wait for the completion of the HTTP request.
In particular, note that when `Network#searchBooks` finishes execution, the HTTP request might not have completed yet.
This is accomplished through the use of a chain of `CompletableFuture` objects, which holds the operations that the above methods wish to apply to the data.
This is most evident in the `executeGetAndApply` method, as shown below:
[source,java]
----
    private <T> CompletableFuture<T> executeGetAndApply(String url, Function<String, ? extends T> fn) {
        return httpClient
                .makeGetRequest(url)
                .thenApply(GoogleBooksApi::requireJsonContentType)
                .thenApply(GoogleBooksApi::requireHttpStatusOk)
                .thenApply(HttpResponse::getResponseBody)
                .thenApply(fn);
    }
----

Once the HTTP request completes, the operations in the `CompletableFuture` objects will be executed. These operations are summarized by the following activity diagram:

image::SearchBooksActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

If the HTTP request fails, the response is unexpected, or the conversion to `BookShelf` fails, then the proceeding operations
added by the calls to `thenApply` will be skipped, and the `CompletableFuture` is considered to have completed exceptionally.
If necessary, the caller can handle the failure by chaining an `exceptionally` call onto the `CompletableFuture` it receives.

[[Search-Command]]
===== Search command

With the network component in place, the `search` command can now be implemented.

When a `search` command is entered, a `SearchCommand` object will be created if the parsing of the command was successful,
which will make a call to `searchBooks` on the `Network` API, as shown in the sequence diagram below:

image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="750"]

As described in <<Search-Network>>, when the event is handled by `NetworkManager`, this will result in an asynchronous HTTP request being made to https://developers.google.com/books/[Google Books API, window="_blank"].
Once the request and the parsing of the response completes successfully, the operation added by the `thenAccept` call in `SearchCommand` will be executed.
This results in the execution of the following method in `SearchCommand`:

[source,java]
----
    private void displaySearchResults(ReadOnlyBookShelf bookShelf) {
        model.updateSearchResults(bookShelf);
        model.setActiveListType(ActiveListType.SEARCH_RESULTS);
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ActiveListChangedEvent());
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new NewResultAvailableEvent(
                String.format(SearchCommand.MESSAGE_SEARCH_SUCCESS, bookShelf.size())));
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new EnableCommandBoxRequestEvent());
    }
----

NOTE: The above method is run on the JavaFX thread (using `Platform#runLater`) because it will result in updates to the book list panel.
If such updates are not done on the JavaFX thread, JavaFX will throw an `IllegalStateException`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Asynchronous vs synchronous

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** HTTP requests are made asynchronously.
** Pros: The application will be more responsive, as potentially long-running HTTP requests will not block the application thread.
** Cons: Not straightforward to implement, especially considering that changes to the UI have to be made on the JavaFX application thread.
* **Alternative 2:** HTTP requests are made synchronously (on the JavaFX application thread).
** Pros: More straightforward to implement, as well as to understand the implementation.
** Cons: The UI will be unresponsive for the duration of the HTTP requests, and this can degrade the user experience.

===== Aspect: Design of network API

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Call methods on the `Network` API directly, which return `CompletableFuture` objects.
** Pros: More explicit flow of data, making it easier to understand and debug.
** Cons: Since web API calls are made by certain commands, the `NetworkManager` will have to be passed from `MainApp` all the way into each `Command`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use events to request for web API calls and retrieve the results.
** Pros: Less coupling - no component will be directly depending on the network component.
** Cons: The flow of data can become less explicit and clear, and it becomes more complicated to use a single web API call for multiple purposes.

===== Aspect: Converting JSON responses to model types

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Convert to a temporary data holder before converting to model type.
** Pros: Easier and more straightforward implementation - a large part of the conversion work is done by the Jackson library.
** Cons: Slower and less efficient - due to the double conversion and the use of the Reflection API (in the Jackson library).
* **Alternative 2:** Convert parsed JSON directly to model type.
** Pros: Faster and more efficient.
** Cons: Code will be more complicated and tedious - we will need to traverse through the JSON node tree manually.
// end::search2[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo previous command

The `undo` command allows the user to undo a previous command that caused changes to the book shelf.
This allows the user to easily reverse their actions.

==== Current Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing of commands that modifies the state of the book shelf (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undo-able_ way, such as saving the state of the book shelf before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th book in the book shelf. The current state of the book shelf is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="700"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add 1` to add a new book.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="700"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack`. We will restore the book shelf to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="700"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="700"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="550"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire book shelf.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the book fetch (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the view is modified (for example `search`), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the book  shelf and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See the discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit status, priority, and rating of books

The `edit` command allows the user to change the priority, status and rating of books in his/her book shelf to facilitate organization and management of books.

==== Current implementation

When `edit` command is entered,

. `EditCommandParser` will extract the index and the parameters from the user input.
. `EditCommandParser` checks that at least one parameter is present, and that the parameter(s) are valid.
. `EditCommandParser` creates an `EditCommand` with the index and parameter(s).
. `EditCommand` is preprocessed to check that `ActiveListType` is correct and index is valid.
. The `Book` to edit (`bookToEdit`) is identified by the index. Another `Book` (`editedBook`) is created based on the specified parameters.
. `editedBook` replaces `bookToEdit` in `BookShelf`.


Sequence Diagram

image::editseq.png[width="550"]


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Presentation of rating

* **Alternative 1:** Show users the rating as a number.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not aesthetically appealing.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Show users the rating as stars.
** Pros: Difficult to implement.
** Cons: Improves the aesthetic appeal and clarity.

===== Aspect: Interpretation of unspecified parameters

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Unspecified parameters are left unchanged.
** Pros: Users can omit parameters that they do not wish to change.
** Cons: More difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Unspecified parameters are set to default value.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Users need to specify all parameters to change one.
// end::edit[]

// tag::recent[]
=== View recently selected books

The `recent` command allows the user to view books that he/she recently selected.
This allows the user to easily look back for a particular book, and to add it into his/her book shelf without having to perform a search again.

==== Current implementation

Recently selected books are stored in a `UniqueBookCircularList` which resides in `ModelManager`.
`Model` exposes a method `addRecentBook(Book)` to add new book selections. Whenever a new book is selected, `LogicManager` handles the `BookListSelectionChangedEvent` and adds the book into the list using `addRecentBook(Book)`.

When `recent` is entered, it will be parsed into a `RecentCommand`, which when executed, sets the `ActiveListType` to `RECENT_BOOKS`.
It then posts `ActiveListChangedEvent` to the `EventCenter` to signal this change. The interaction between components is shown in the diagram below.

image::SequenceDiagramRecentCommandLogic.png[width="550"]

NOTE: `ActiveListType` is needed because the commands that users can perform on different lists differ. For example, users cannot delete books if the `ActiveListType` is `RECENT_BOOKS`.

`ActiveListChangedEvent` is handled by `MainWindow`, which updates the list displayed in `BookListPanel`.

image::SequenceDiagramRecentCommandEvent.png[width="450"]

`UniqueBookCircularList` has size 50 by default. For illustration purposes, assume we have a
`UniqueBookCircularList` of size 2 that is empty at the start. `ActiveListType` is `BOOK_SHELF`.

The user performs `select 1` to view information on the 1st book in the book shelf. The
selected book is added onto the `UniqueBookCircularList`.

image::RecentCommandListOne.png[width="450"]

NOTE: If select fails to execute (eg. given index is invalid), the list will remain unchanged.

The user then selects another book with `select 2`. The book is added to the front of the `UniqueBookCircularList`.

image::RecentCommandListTwo.png[width="450"]

NOTE: Selecting a book directly from the UI (without using `select` command) will also update the list according.

Now if the user performs `select 1` again, the book `One`, which already exists in the list, will be removed
from the list and added again so that it is in the first index of the list (most recently selected).

image::RecentCommandListThree.png[width="450"]

Note that the `UniqueBookCircularList` is currently full. When user performs `select 3`, since
`Three` is not in the list, the book at the last index (the least recent selection) is removed to make space for `Three` (`Two` in this case).

image::RecentCommandListFour.png[width="450"]

NOTE: `UniqueBookCircularList::equals` is order sensitive since the order determines the recency.

When Bibliotek is exited, the data in the `UniqueBookCircularList` is stored in the format
of `BookShelf`. This data is read and converted to `UniqueBookCircularList` upon opening Bibliotek.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Type of selected books that are shown

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All books selected from the user's book shelf or search results.
** Pros: More intuitive for the user.
** Cons: Users can easily find books in his book shelf. Including these books in `recent` list
may not be useful and take up space.
* **Alternative 2:** Only books selected from the user's search results.
** Pros: Users are more likely to need `recent` to find these books. We can reduce clutter
by only showing these books.
** Cons: Less intuitive for the user. We also need to deal with books that are added or deleted after selection.

===== Aspect: Data structure to hold the recently selected books data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make a new type of book list `UniqueBookCircularList`.
** Pros: Can make the size limit and add mechanism a property of the new list.
** Cons: Have to deal with multiple data structures to hold data for different purposes.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `BookShelf`.
** Pros: Re-use of existing data structure.
** Cons: `BookShelf` supports functionalities that are not needed to store recently selected books.
// end::recent[]

// tag::library[]
=== Check for availability of book in NLB library

The `library` command allows the user to easily check for the availability of books in NLB libraries.
This eliminates the need to manually enter search information into the NLB catalogue. The user can use this information to decide when or whether to read a book.

==== Current implementation

When a `library` command is entered, a `LibraryCommand` will be created if the parsing of the command was successful, which will
make a call to `searchLibraryForBook(Book)` on the `Network` API. This will result in an asynchronous HTTP request being made to
https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/EXPNOS/NLBHOME?HOMEPRMS=NLBGENPARAMS[NLB Catalogue].
Once the HTTP request completes, the operations in the `.thenApply(...)`, shown in the code block below, will execute.

[source,java]
----
    private CompletableFuture<String> execute(String url, Book book) {
        return httpClient
                .makeGetRequest(url)
                .thenApply(NlbCatalogueApi::requireHtmlContentType)
                .thenApply(NlbCatalogueApi::requireHttpStatusOk)
                .thenApply(HttpResponse::getResponseBody)
                .thenApply(result -> NlbResultHelper.getUrl(result, book));
    }
----

This is summarized by the following activity diagram:

image::LibraryCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

The `CompletableFuture` completes exceptionally if the content type or status code is wrong.
Else, a URL of the page showing availability of the target book, if any, is obtained.
This depends on the response HTML, which can be categorized into the following:

* Full display (the page we want): The URL which the HTTP GET request was made to is returned.
* Non-empty list of results: The URL of the top result is returned.
* Empty list of results: A custom message, reporting that no result is found, is returned.

Once the necessary result is obtained, the following method in `LibraryCommand` is executed:

[source,java]
----
    private void onSuccessfulRequest(String result, Book book) {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowLibraryResultRequestEvent(result));
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new NewResultAvailableEvent(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, book)));
    }
----

`ShowLibraryResultRequestEvent` is handled by `MainWindow` and `BookInLibraryPanel` to load the URL using a `WebView` and display the webpage.
The loaded page is post-processed using a script to show only the relevant section.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to show availability of the book

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Load the webpage using a `WebView`.
** Pros: Immune to changes in structure of that webpage.
** Cons: Lesser flexibility in structure and content. Also subject to limitations of `WebView`.
* **Alternative 2:** Extract the relevant information from the HTTP response and design a new panel to show the results.
** Pros: Greater control over structure and content.
** Cons: Vulnerable to changes in structure of that webpage.

===== Aspect: Using advanced search versus basic search

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform basic search, which uses a HTTP GET request.
** Pros: Faster response time.
** Cons: Searched keyword seems to be matched to title or authors only.
* **Alternative 2:** Perform advanced search, which uses a HTTP POST request.
** Pros: Able to limit the search results using more parameters such as publication year or ISBN.
** Cons: Slower response time.

===== Aspect: Whether to load in `WebView` directly or pre-process through `Network` component

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pre-process HTTP response in `Network` component, then send intended URL to `WebView`.
** Pros: Processing happens behind the scene, and does not distract the user.
** Cons: User is subject to waiting times without feedback on progress. Furthermore, the control flow becomes more complicated since a URL still needs to be passed to and loaded on the `WebView` eventually.
* **Alternative 2:** Load search URL in `WebView` and navigate to intended page using script.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Eliminate the need to modify `Network` component.
** Cons: User will be able to see the navigation between pages.

// tag::alias[]
=== Command aliasing

The command aliasing system allows the user to specify short command aliases to use in place of the original commands.
This improves the user experience by reducing the amount of typing the user needs to do.

==== Current Implementation

The user can customize their command aliases using the `addalias` and `deletealias` commands.
These commands allow the user to add and delete aliases respectively.

===== Adding command aliases

When the user attempts to add a new command alias using `addalias ALIAS_NAME cmd/COMMAND`, the user input will first be
validated and pre-processed by `AddAliasCommandParser`.

`AddAliasCommandParser` verifies that both the `ALIAS_NAME` and `COMMAND` are non-empty, before
searching the `COMMAND` for the first occurrence of an empty space that is followed by a named command parameter.
Using this point, the parser will split the `COMMAND` into two parts - the prefix, and the named arguments.
The figure below shows an example for the `edit 12 s/reading p/high` command.

image::AliasSampleCommand.png[width="300"]

The searching and splitting is accomplished using the following regular expression.

[source,java]
----
    private static final Pattern COMMAND_FORMAT = Pattern.compile("(?<prefix>((?! \\w+\\/.*)[\\S ])+)(?<namedArgs>.*)");
----

Following this pre-processing step, a new `Alias` will be created using the alias name, command prefix, and named arguments.

[source,java]
----
    private static Alias createAlias(String aliasName, Matcher commandMatcher) {
        return new Alias(aliasName, commandMatcher.group("prefix"), commandMatcher.group("namedArgs"));
    }
----

The `Alias` is then added to the `UniqueAliasList` in `ModelManager`, and this update will cause an `AliasListChangedEvent` to be posted.
The event is handled by `StorageManager`, which saves the updated alias list to `data/aliaslist.xml`.

NOTE: There are currently no checks in place to prevent the user from adding a command alias that refers to an invalid or non-existent built-in command.

===== Using command aliases

The user can use command aliases in the same way they use normal commands. In this section, we assume that the user added `rd` as an alias for `edit s/reading`.

Whenever a command is entered into the command box, the command will be passed by `LogicManager` into `BookShelfParser#applyCommandAlias`,
where an attempt will be made to apply a matching command alias.

The application of a command alias begins by splitting the input into three parts - the alias name (first word in the input), unnamed arguments, and named arguments.
The figure below shows an example for the `rd 12 p/high` command.

image::AliasSampleCommand2.png[width="300"]

This splitting is accomplished using the following regular expression.

[source,java]
----
    private static final Pattern ALIASED_COMMAND_FORMAT =
            Pattern.compile(" *(?<aliasName>\\S+)(?<unnamedArgs>((?! [\\w]+\\/.*)[\\S ])*)(?<namedArgs>.*)");
----

If the alias name matches that of an existing alias, then the alias will be applied.
Otherwise, the input will be returned unchanged. In this case, the alias named `rd` will be applied.

The result of the application of the alias is a new command that is formed by splicing parts of the user input into the aliased command.
Using `rd 12 p/high` as the user input, this process is demonstrated in the figure below.

image::AliasApplication.png[width="560"]

The resulting command, `edit 12 s/reading p/high`, will then be parsed and executed, instead of the original user input.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Inclusion of command parameters in aliases

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow aliasing of command parameters, together with the command word.
** Pros: Increases the usefulness of the command aliasing system.
** Cons: Less straightforward to implement, especially considering that some commands may require an index that comes before the named parameters.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allow command words to be aliased.
** Pros: More straightforward to implement.
** Cons: Limits the usefulness of the command aliasing system, especially for users who may need to use certain commands that contain parameters regularly, e.g. `list s/high by/status`.
// end::alias[]

// tag::encrypt[]
=== Encrypt data

This allows the user to protect his book shelf data with a password so that others cannot gain access to these data.

==== Current implementation

===== Encrypt the Bookshelf.xml
An addition class `CipherEngine` is added to the `Bookshelf` class. This class contatins some methods
  to encrypt or decrypt file(`Bookshelf.xml`)and `password`. +
  Note that when 'CipherEngine' encrypt the file, it will use the (encryped)`password`.

  * ** Every time user make change in `Bookshelf` **

  . The `model manager` will post an `BookshelfChangedEvent`.
  . Before saving the data into `Bookshelf.xml`, the system will check whether `Bookshelf` is protected by the `password`(checking
  whether the `password` is `defaultpassword`: "").
  . When the `password` is not default, the `Bookshelf.xml` will be encrypted.

  * ** Every time user set the new `password` **

  . The `Setpwcommand` will check the `password`.
  . If the new `password` is equal to "", the `Lockmanager` will set `isProtected` to be false.
  . The isProtect will be checked by `xmlBookshelfstorage` whether to  encrypt the "Bookshelf.xml" and save
   the data into `Bookshelf.xml`.

  * ** When the system need to be encrypt **

  . The `password` will be encode, and set it to be a key to encrypt the file(`Bookshelf.xml`).

===== Lock the book shelf

An addition class `LockManager` is added to save the password and the situation of the locking system. +
The default `password` provided for the new user is defaultpassword(""), which means that the `Bookshelf` is not locked.

  * ** When `Lock` command is entered **
  . `LockCommand` is processed to set `isLock`(`LockManager`) to be true.


NOTE:  . The `Bookshelf` cannot be run any command except `unlock` and `help` command.

  * **When the `Bookshelf` is locked and `unlock` command is entered**

  . `UnlockCommandParser` will extract `password` from the user input.
  . `UnlockCommandParser` creates an `UnlockCommand` for the `password`.
  . `UnlockCommand` is preprocessed to execute `LockManager`'s unlock(password).
  . If the password is corrct, the unlock will be run successfully, otherwise it will send a WRONG_PASSWORD commandresult.
  . `UnlockCommand` is processed to set isLock(LockManager) to be false.

  * **When `setpw` command is entered**

  . `setpasswordCommandParser` will extract the old key and new key from the user input.
  . `setpwParser` checks that  two parameters are valid.
  . `setpasswordCommandParser` creates an `setpwCommand` with the parameters.
  . `setpwCommand` is preprocessed to check that oldKey is correct using `LockManager`.
  . If the oldKey is correct, `setpwCommand` will post a `passwordChangedevent`.
  . MainApp will handle it, and set `UserPrefs.password` to be new encoded `password`(using cipherEngine).

  * The encode key are implement in this way:
  [source,java]
----
    public static String encrypKey(String mykey) throws Exception {
        byte[] byarray = encrypt(mykey.getBytes(ENCODE), defaultKey.getBytes(ENCODE));
        String encryptkey = new BASE64Encoder().encode(byarray);
        return encryptkey;
    }

    public static byte[] encrypt(byte[] mykey, byte[] key) throws Exception {
        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();

        DESKeySpec desKeySpec = new DESKeySpec(key);

        SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(DES);
        SecretKey securekey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(desKeySpec);

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(DES);

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, securekey, secureRandom);

        return cipher.doFinal(mykey);
    }
----

* The encode key are implement in this way:
[source,java]
----
    public static String decryptKey(String yourkey) throws IOException, Exception {
        if (yourkey == null) {
            return null;
        }
        BASE64Decoder base64Decoder = new BASE64Decoder();
        byte[] decodeBuffer = base64Decoder.decodeBuffer(yourkey);
        byte[] bytes = decrypt(decodeBuffer, defaultKey.getBytes(ENCODE));
        return new String(bytes, ENCODE);
    }

    private static byte[] decrypt(byte[] yourkey, byte[] key) throws Exception {

        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();

        DESKeySpec desKeySpec = new DESKeySpec(key);

        SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(DES);
        SecretKey securekey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(desKeySpec);

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(DES);

        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, securekey, secureRandom);

        return cipher.doFinal(yourkey);
    }
----
// end::encrypt[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to use three commands instead of only one

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use three commands to do the lock, unlock and setpassword actions.
** Pros: Users can clearly know what they can do about the password.
** Cons: Users should learn two more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Use only one `setpw` command to solve all three features.
** Pros: Seem that users can eliminate the typing.
** Cons: Users will feel confuse, not so clear about the command.

===== Aspect: Whether to encode the password before store it

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the encoded password.
** Pros: Others cannot know users' passwords easily.
** Cons: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the text form password.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Others can know users' passwords easily.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

Below are the different *logging levels* and descriptions of when each level should be used.

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application (e.g App name, logging level) can be controlled through the configuration file (default: `config.json` which can be found in your project folder).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu. You should see a pop-up similar to Figure 12 below.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, follow the settings as indicated in Figure 12.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section includes some information that may be useful for testing the project.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX, window="_blank"_] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

**Problem: `AddCommandSystemTest` or `SearchCommandSystemTest` fails with a `GuiRobot$EventTimeoutException`.**

* Reason: The required data could not be fetched from the online service within 10s. The service could be down at the moment.
* Solution: Check that you are connected to the Internet, or if you are, try again later.

== Dev Ops

This section contains some information or tools that may be useful for managing the project.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://circleci.com/[CircleCI, window="_blank"], https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI, window="_blank"], and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor, window="_blank"_] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See <<UsingCircleCI#, UsingCircleCI.adoc>>, <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>>, and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls, window="_blank"] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify, window="_blank"] to see a preview of how the
HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`, window="_blank"].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number, e.g. `v0.1`.
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub, window="_blank"] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Bibliotek depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library, window="_blank"_] for XML parsing.
We make use of Gradle to manage the project dependencies. Gradle can automate the downloading of these dependencies, saving us time and effort.

While strongly discouraged by us, you can nevertheless opt for one of the following alternatives.

* Include those libraries in the repo (though this bloats the repo size).
* Download those libraries manually (though this creates extra work for you).

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for a new user, who has not set up any custom aliases yet, to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all books in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditCommand.java[`EditCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `EditCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParser.java[`BookShelfParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParser.java[`BookShelfParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove all custom aliases for a certain command, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeAliasForCommand(String)` method. All aliases for the specified command will be removed from the alias list.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/UniqueAliasList.java[`UniqueAliasList`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting aliases?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/UniqueAliasList.java[`UniqueAliasList`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/Alias.java[`Alias`] classes are used in implementing the removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/UniqueAliasList.java[`UniqueAliasList`] allows you to remove an alias, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/Alias.java[`Alias`] allows you to access the alias prefix.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeAliasWithPrefix(String)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/alias/UniqueAliasList.java[`UniqueAliasList`]. Loop through each alias, and remove the alias if the prefix of the alias matches the given `String`.
** Add a new API method `removeAliasForCommand(String)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `UniqueAliasList#removeAliasWithPrefix(String)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how users use Bibliotek. You realize that one user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A second user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last book in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/BibliotekSystemTest.java[`BibliotekSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and BibliotekSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the book shelf is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of books when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleBookShelfChangedEvent(BookShelfChangedEvent)`] to update the number of books whenever there are new changes to the book shelf.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of books status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/BibliotekSystemTest.java[`BibliotekSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of books status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the book shelf to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the book shelf after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the book shelf storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupBookShelf(ReadOnlyBookShelf)`, so that the book shelf can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/BookShelfStorage.java[`BookShelfStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlBookShelfStorage.java[`XmlBookShelfStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for Bibliotek, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular book, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each book. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a book specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Recommended by YX.` +
Edits the remark for the first book to `Recommended by YX.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first book.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParser.java[`BookShelfParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParserTest.java[`BookShelfParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Recommended by YX.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParser.java[`BookShelfParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/BookShelfParserTest.java[`BookShelfParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `BookCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] s to display a remark for each book later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/BookListCard.fxml[`BookListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/BookCardHandle.java[`BookCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/book/Description.java[`Description`] and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Book` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `edit` command to modify the remarks field.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `bookshelf.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedBook` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Book` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedBook.java[`XmlAdaptedBook`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidBookBookShelf.xml`, `typicalBooksBookShelf.xml`, `validBookShelf.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `BookBuilder`
Since `Book` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/BookBuilder.java[`BookBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/BookBuilder.java[`BookBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the book that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Book` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalBooks.java[`TypicalBooks`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `BookCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Book` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysBook(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a book.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample books. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a book

. Deleting a book while all books are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all books using the `list` command. Multiple books in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First book is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted book shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No book is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Searching for a book in the library

. Prerequisites: Have a non-empty list of books in the left panel.
. Test case: `library 1` +
.. Immediately: Bibliotek shows `Searching for the book in the library...`. Everything else remains the same. You are still able to interact with the GUI. +
.. After some time: Bibliotek shows `Showing availability of book: TITLE - Authors: AUTHORS`. The right panel should start loading (a white screen is first seen). +
.. When loading is complete: A table with the availability of the book at different libraries is shown in the right panel. +
.. Exception: Bibliotek shows `Failed to retrieve information from online.` if the request has failed or timed out (10s). This may be because you are not connected to the internet, or the response from NLB Catalogue is slow.
.. Interrupted: If you performed other commands when `library` is in progress, note that the webpage will still load when the search is done and replace whatever is in the right panel.
. Test case: `library 0`, `library x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
..  Expected: Bibliotek shows `The book index provided is invalid`. No change should happen other than the message showing.
. Test case: `librar 1` (Test integration with command autocorrect) +
.. Expected: Bibliotek asks whether you meant `library 1`.
.. If you press Enter, the command should execute the same fashion as test case in (b).
. Test case: `LiBrArY 1` (Test for case insensitivity) +
..  Expected: The command executes in the same fashion as test case in (b).
. Test case: `library` (Test for invalid format) +
.. Expected: Bibliotek shows message on correct use of `library`.

=== Viewing recently selected books

. Prerequisites: Have a non-empty list of books in the left panel.
. Assumes: Have not recently selected any books.
. Test case: `list`, `select 1`, `recent` +
.. Expected: There is one book in the recently selected books list.
. Test case: `search hello`, `select 1`, `recent` +
.. Assumes: Searched completed successfully and selection is made, which is different from selection above.
.. Expected: There is another book in the recently selected book list, at index 1.
. Test case: `list`, `select 1`, `recent` +
.. Expected: The first book is brought up to the first index in the recent books list
. Test case: `select 2` (in the recent book list) +
.. Expected: The position of the book selected in the recent book list does not change in the list.

=== Saving data
