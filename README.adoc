Ever feels overwhelmed in managing all your employees?
Ever wants to keep track of all the tasks you have assigned to your employees?

Employees Tracker (E.T.) comes to the rescue!

E.T. is a *Human Resource Manager* desktop application that helps managers to manage their subordinates. Its has 2 main functionalities: providing information about employees,
as well as helping in tracking the tasks assigned to each employee. Its User Interface (UI) is a hybrid of Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). That said, ET will suit you better
if you can type fast and are familiar with CLI!
