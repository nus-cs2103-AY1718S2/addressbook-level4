// tag::introduction[]
== Introduction
Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is a desktop records management application targeted at private clinics that may have multiple branches.
It aims to replace how private clinics handle the management of patient records, making the process much more easier and efficient.
It provides features that are essential for a clinic to manage patient records effectively and securely such as user authentication, managing patient records, managing pateint appointments, maintaining of a visting queue, and the printing of medical records.
This guide provides the necessary information for developers who are interested in contributing to the application - from the steps required to set-up, to detailed descriptions of the current features that the application features.
// end::introduction[]

== Setting Up
This section details how you can go about setting up IMDB.

=== Prerequisites
Please ensure the following are installed before setting up IMDB: +

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

If this is your first time running IMDB, please follow the following steps to ensure a successful setup of IMDB:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

To verify if you have set up IMDB correctly, please do the following:

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass

=== Configurations to do before writing code

To ensure that the modifications you make are in line with the codebase, you should make sure that you follow the coding style and standards adopted for this application.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: Use the following order: `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Getting started with coding

You are now ready to start coding. You may wish to refer to the links below for more information:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>

== Design
This section provides an explanation of how IMDB is designed.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The high-level design of the IMDB is given in Figure 1 below. +

.Architecture diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

{empty} +

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

The App consists of the following components:

* `Main`: Consists of only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>: Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Acts as the UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Acts as the command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Given below is an overview of each component.

`Main` is responsible for the following:

* At app launch: It initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: It shuts down the components and invokes the cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> has two major classes that play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : Used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
This class is written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library].
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the 4 components does the following:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 2 below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.
{empty} +

=== Events-driven Nature

The _Sequence Diagram_ given in Figure 3 below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.
{empty} +
{empty} +

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `IMDBChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
The overview of the structure of the `UI` component is given below in Figure 5. +

.Structure of the UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
You may wish to refer to the following for more information about the API of the `UI` component: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`UI.java`]

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these `UI` parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
The `UI` component also binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the it can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
The `UI` component responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the itself accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
The overview of the structure of the `Logic` component is given below in Figure 6. +

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Figure 7 below shows the finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>> +

.Structure of commands in the logic component.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

You may wish to refer to the following for more information about the API of the `Logic` component:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The `Logic` component first uses the `IMDBParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
The command execution can then affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient) and/or raise events.
Lastly, the result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below in Figure 8 is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

{empty} +

.Interactions inside the logic component for the `delete 1` Command

{empty} +

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The overview of the structure of the `Model` component is given in Figure 9 below. +

.Structure of the model component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

You may wish to refer to the following for more information about the API of the `Model` component:
 link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The overview of the structure of the `Storage` component is given in Figure 10 below. +

.Structure of the storage component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

You may wish to refer to the following for more information about the API of the `Storage` component: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. Figure 11 shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Structure of the logic component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th patient in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved
before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack`
(the current state is saved together with the command), as shown in Figure 12 below.

.Structure of the stacks before and after deletion
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`, as shown in Figure 13 below. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new patient.

.Structure of the stacks before and after addition
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`.
We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed, as shown in Figure 14 below.

.Structure of the stacks before and after redoing
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The sequence diagram shown in Figure 15 displays how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram detailing the undo operation in action
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`, as shown in Figure 16 below. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Structure of the stacks before and after clearing
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution, as shown in Figure 17 below.

.Structure of the stacks before and after listing
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Figure 18 summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Activity diagram summary of the stacks whenever a command is executed
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: Will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern and is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Will result in classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` needing to call `super.execute()`, or they will lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Undo/redo is done by each individual command.
** Pros: Will use less memory usage (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
** Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: Only need to revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: Might result in user thinking that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: No way of skipping commands if user just wants to reset the state of IMDB and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Will result in `Logic` being duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: Not necessary to maintain a separate stack, just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Will need to deal with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::remark[]
=== Edit remarks feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit remarks mechanism is facilitated by a `RemarkCommand`.
It supports editing the remarks of a `Patient` to match the user input. `RemarkCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

The edit remarks mechanism functions like that of the `EditCommand`. It searches for the patient to be edited based on the index provided
by the user. It then creates a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, changing the remarks attribute to
match the user input. The `RemarkCommand` then calls for the utility method `updatePerson` under `Model`, to replace the patient to be
edited with the edited patient.

The `Patient` is updated in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(patientToEdit);
        requireNonNull(editedPatient);

        try {
            model.updatePerson(patientToEdit, editedPatient);
        } catch (DuplicatePatientException dpe) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        } catch (PatientNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target patient cannot be missing");
        }
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
        return new CommandResult(generateSuccessMessage(editedPatient));
    }
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The current patient queue is shown in Figure 19 below.

.The current queue
image::Figure 3.2.1.1.PNG[width="800"]

The user now decides to edit the remarks of the first person in the list.

`RemarkCommand` will search for the first person in the list and store it as the person to be edited.
`RemarkCommand` will then create a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, except the remarks attribute
which will be based on the user input. This new patient will be stored as the edited patient as shown in Figure 20 below.

.The patient before and after editing
image::Figure 3.2.1.2.PNG[width="800"]

`RemarkCommand` will finally call the for the utility method `updatePerson` under `Model`, to replace the patient to be edited with the edited patient,
the new list will be as shown in Figure 21 below.

.The queue with updated details
image::Figure 3.2.1.3.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RemarkCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a duplicate `Patient` and utilise `updatePerson` to replace the `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a public method in `Remark` for updating the remark which will be called by `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new patient object).
** Cons: Will require public access to `Remark` stored in `Patient` (possible security concerns).

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the remark command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Remark` that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to understand for new developers as it follows existing structures.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a String that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new remark object).
** Cons: Will require a method in Patient to update and verify validity of remark. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `Patient` now needs to do two different things.
// end::remark[]

// tag::addconditions[]
=== Edit conditions feature
==== Current Implementation

The management of conditions mechanism is managed by `AddConditionCommand` and `DeleteConditionCommand`.
They are modified from `EditCommand` to only edit conditions. The following is the code snippet for how they work.

[source,java]
----
Add Condition:
    private static Patient createEditedPerson(...) {
        ...

        if (patientToEdit.getTags() != null) {
            updatedTags = new HashSet<>();
            updatedTags.addAll(patientToEdit.getTags());
            updatedTags.addAll(editPersonDescriptor.getModifiableTags());
        }

        return new Patient(...);
    }

Delete Condition:
    private static Patient createEditedPerson(...) {
        ...

        if (patientToEdit.getTags() != null) {
            updatedTags = new HashSet<>();
            updatedTags.addAll(patientToEdit.getTags());
            updatedTags.removeAll(editPersonDescriptor.getModifiableTags());
        }

        return new Patient(...);
    }


----

It allows the user to simply add on to, or delete from, the list of conditions a patient has rather than have to retype all of the patient's conditions.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The current list is shown in Figure 22 below.

.The current queue
image::Figure3-4-1-1.png[width="800"]

The user now adds a `seafood` allergy to `David`{empty}'s list of medical conditions.

`AddConditionCommand` will select the person in the list based on the index provided and store it as the person to be edited.
`AddConditionCommand` will then create a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, except the `Condition` attribute which now has additional conditions
based on the user input. This new patient will be stored as the edited patient as shown in Figure 23 below.

.The patient before and after editing
image::Figure3-4-1-2.png[width="800"]

`EditCommand` will finally call the for the utility method `updatePerson` under `Model`, to replace the patient to be edited with the edited patient,
the new list will be as shown in Figure 24 below.

.The queue with updated details
image::Figure3-4-1-3.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddConditionCommand` and `DeleteConditionCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a duplicate `Patient` and utilise `updatePerson` to replace the `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a public method in `UniqueTagList` for updating the remark which will be called by `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new patient object).
** Cons: Will require public access to the internal `UniqueTagList` (possible security concerns).
// end::addconditions[]

// tag::addqremoveq[]
=== Patient visiting queue features
==== Current Implementation

The patient visiting queue mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePatientVisitingQueue`, `AddPatientQueueCommand` and `RemovePatientQueueCommand`.
It supports the adding and removing of a patient from the visiting queue. `AddPatientQueueCommand` and `RemovePatientQueueCommand` inherit from `Command`.

The addition mechanism functions like that of the `AddCommand` but uses only the current list index of the patient. It stores the actual index of the patient in the unfiltered patient list in the visiting queue.
The user can find patients with certain keywords in their name using `FindCommand` then add them into queue according to the list index displayed.
The `AddPatientQueueCommand` then calls for the utility method `addPatientToQueue` under `ModelManager`, to update the visiting queue and triggers an `IMDBChangedEvent` to the `UI` to update `VisitingQueuePanel`.

Code snippet below shows how add patient into visiting queue work.

[source,java]
----

Preprocess before adding patient to queue:

    try {
        actualSourceIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(actualIndexInString);
    } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
        throw new AssertionError("The target patient cannot be missing");
    }

Add operation:

    try {
        toQueue = model.addPatientToQueue(actualSourceIndex);
    } catch (DuplicatePatientException e) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
    }

----


Suppose that the user has just launched the application and logged in as a medical staff. The empty queue is shown in Figure 25 below.

.The empty queue
image::emptyVisitQueue.png[width="800"]


The user now decides to add a patient into the queue.


`AddPatientQueueCommand` will check if the index given is valid and is in the bound of the current list displayed. If the given index is valid and in the bound, `AddPatientQueueCommand` will then call the for the utility method `addPatientToQueue` under `ModelManager`, to add the patient index into the visiting queue.
The updated queue is shown in Figure 26 below.


.The updated queue
image::patientInQueue.png[width="800"]



The removal mechanism functions like that of the `DeleteCommand`. If no parameters are provided, it removes the first patient of the queue.
If the user wants to remove a specific patient in the queue, the user can provide the patient index displayed in the queue.
The `RemovePatientQueueCommand` then calls for the utility method `removePatientFromQueue` under `Model`, to update the visiting queue and trigger an `IMDBChangedEvent` to `UI` to update the `VisitingQueuePanel`.

Code snippet below shows how `RemovePatientQueueCommand` handle two different format of `removeq` command.

[source,java]
----

Preprocess before removing patient tfrom visiting queue:

    if (indexArguementIsExist) {
        //Unfilter patient list
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= model.getFilteredPersonList().size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }
    }

Remove operation:

    try {
        Patient patientToRemove;
        if (indexArguementIsExist) {
            patientToRemove = model.removePatientFromQueueByIndex(targetIndex);
        } else {
            patientToRemove = model.removePatientFromQueue();
        }
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_REMOVE_SUCCESS, patientToRemove.getName().toString()));
    } catch (PatientNotFoundException e) {

        if (model.getVisitingQueue().size() > 0) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_PERSON_NOT_FOUND_QUEUE);
        }

        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_QUEUE_EMPTY);
    }

----


Suppose that the queue contains patients as shown in Figure 27 below.


.The queue containing some patients
image::patientsInQueue.png[width="800"]



The user now decides to remove the first patient from the queue.


`RemovePatientQueueCommand` will then call the for the utility method `removePatientFromQueue` under `ModelManager`, to remove the patient from the visiting queue and triggers an `IMDBChangedEvent` to the `UI` to update `VisitingQueuePanel`.
The updated queue is shown in Figure 28 below.

.The queue after a patient is removed
image::patientInQueueRemoveState.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations for patient visiting queue features, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the AddPatientQueue and RemovePatientQueue command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use LinkedList as a queue to store the patient index only
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have utility limitation and have to take care how other commands affect the patient index in the list for example DeleteCommand.
* **Alternative 2:** Use ObservableList as queue to store patient object
** Pros: Can get rid of possible bug caused by the flexibility of the list index.
** Cons: May give redundancy for this feature because no modification will be done on the patient object.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddPatientQueueCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only add the patient to the back of the list
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Does not allow user to add a patient in the position they want in the queue.
* **Alternative 2:** Add the patient to any position in the queue
** Pros: Will improve the functionality of AddPatientQueue command.
** Cons: Will require another implementation to add patient in the specified position in the queue.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RemovePatientQueueCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove the patient from the queue regardless of position
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Will be error prone since list index is flexible with the operation that user typed in.
* **Alternative 2:** Remove the patient from the queue using their NRIC
** Pros: Will remove any errors caused by removing a patient from the queue by their index.
** Cons: Will require extra checking and verification.

=== Patient appointment features
==== Current Implementation

The patient appointment mechanism is facilitated by `Appointment`, `AppointmentEntry`, `DateTime`, `UniqueAppointmentEntryList`, `UniqueAppointmentList`, `AddAppointmentCommand`, `DeleteAppointmentCommand`, `ViewAppoinmentCommand`, `AddAppointmenetCommandParser`, `DeleteAppoinmentCommandParser` and `ViewAppointmentCommandParser`.
It supports the adding, deleting and viewing of patient appointments. `AddAppointmentCommand`, `DeleteAppointmentCommand` and `ViewAppoinmentCommand` inherit from `Command`.

The add new patient appointment mechanism functions like that of the `AddCommand` with current list index of the patient, date, and time as inputs. `AddAppointmenetCommandParser` will verify the user input format and pass to `AddAppointmentCommand` to handle adding of appointment operation. It also make sure that the date provided is after the current date (date of today) and is not book by other patients. If verification is correct, a new appointment object with date and time will be created and is stored in the patient's list of appointments.
The user can find patients using the `FindCommand` and then add a new appointment according to the current list index displayed.
The `AddPatientQueueCommand` then calls for the utility method addPatientAppointment under `Model` to add a new patient appointment and trigger an `IMDBChangedEvent` to the `UI` to update PatientAppointmentPanel or CalendarPanel.

Code snippet below shows how `AddAppointmenetCommandParser` verify user inputs.

[source,java]
----

String trimmedArgs = args.trim();

if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty()) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
            AddAppointmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

String[] argsArray = trimmedArgs.split("\\s");

if (argsArray.length < NO_OF_ARGUMENTS) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
            AddAppointmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

try {
    Index targetPatientIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argsArray[PATIENT_INDEX_INDEX]);
    DateTime appointmentDateTime = ParserUtil.parseDateTime(argsArray[DATE_INDEX] + " "
            + argsArray[TIME_INDEX]);
    if (DateTime.isBefore(argsArray[DATE_INDEX] + " " + argsArray[TIME_INDEX])) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                AddAppointmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
    return new AddAppointmentCommand(targetPatientIndex, appointmentDateTime);
} catch (IllegalValueException e) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
            AddAppointmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application and logged in as a medical staff. Bernice's appointment list is shown Figure 29 below.

.Bernice's appointment list contain some appointments
image::appointment_list.png[width="800"]

The user now decides to add a new appointment on 20/7/2018 3pm for Bernice.

`AddAppointmenetCommandParser` will verify if the input given is in correct format and the date given is valid. If the input is valid, `AddAppointmenetCommand` will then call for the utility method `addPatientAppointment` under `ModelManager`, to add the new appointment into the appointment list of Bernice. The update appointment list is shown in Figure 30 below.


.Bernice's appointment list updated
image::appointment_list_add.png[width="800"]


The delete appointment mechanism functions like that of the `DeleteCommand` with current list index of the patient, date, and time as inputs. `DeleteAppointmenetCommandParser` will verify the user input format and pass to `DeleteAppointmenetCommand` to handle deleting of appointment operation. The verification steps are similar to `DeleteAppointmenetCommandParser` If verification is correct, the `DeleteAppointmenetCommand` then calls for the utility method deletePatientAppointment under `ModelManager`, remove the appointment if the appointment is exist in the patient's appointment list and trigger an `IMDBChangedEvent` to `UI` to update PatientAppointmentPanel or CalendarPanel.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application and logged in as a medical staff. Bernice’s appointment list is shown Figure 31 below.

.Bernice's appointment list updated
image::appointment_list_add.png[width="800"]

Now the user receives Bernice's request to cancel an appointment on 22/6/2018 11am.

`DeleteAppointmenetCommandParser` will verify if the input given is in correct format. If the input is valid, `DeleteAppointmenetCommand` will then call for the utility method `deletePatientAppointment` under `ModelManager`, to delete the appointment from the appointment list of Bernice. The updated appointment list is shown in Figure 31 below.

.Bernice's appointment list updated
image::appointment_list_del.png[width="800"]

The view appointment mechanism functions like that of the `findCommand` and `listCommand` depends on whether the current list index of the patient is provided.  If patient index is provided, the `viewAppointmentCommand` then calls for the utility method getPatientFromListByIndex by patient index under `ModelManager`, to get the patient and trigger an `IMDBChangedEvent` to `UI` to update PatientAppointmentPanel to display list of past and upcoming appoinments made by this patient. If the current list index of the patient is not provided, the `viewAppointmentCommand` then calls for the utility method getAppointmentEntryList under `ModelManager`, to get the list of appointments made by all patients and trigger an `IMDBChangedEvent` to `UI` to update CalendarPanel.

Code snippet below shows how `ViewAppoinmentCommand` handle two different format of `viewappt` commands.

[source,java]
----

if (indexArgumentIsExist) {
    targetPatient = model.getPatientFromListByIndex(targetIndex);
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowPatientAppointmentRequestEvent(targetPatient));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS_PATIENT, targetPatient.getName().fullName));
} else {
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowCalendarViewRequestEvent(model.getAppointmentEntryList()));
}

----

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations for patient appointment features, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the AddAppointmentCommand and DeleteAppointmentCommand and viewAppointmentCommand

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Usetwo separate customised data structure to store appointments for each patient and appointments for all patient (master list) to be displayed on the calendar panel
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have redundant methods in both data structure.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a appointment superclass or interface and extends from it
** Pros: Will be able to customise functionality of the data structure and get rid of redundant methods.
** Cons: May not find similar behaviour between this two classes.

===== Aspect: Implementation of AddAppointmentCommand
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add new appointment using current list index of patient.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: Will be error prone since list index is flexible with the operation that user typed in..
* **Alternative 2:** Add new appointment using patient's NRIC.
** Pros: Will add the new appointment for the correct patient.
** Cons: Will require extra checking for patient's NRIC uniqueness upon adding into IMDB.

===== Aspect: Implementation of DeleteAppointmentCommand
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove an appointment using date and time as input.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May delete the incorrect appointment if users do not check the input they type before entering the command.
* **Alternative 2:** Remove appointment by appointment list index.
** Pros: Can prevent user from deleting the wrong appointment.
** Cons: Will require implementation to maintain the appointment index.


// end::addqremoveappt[]

// tag::record[]
=== Edit records feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit records mechanism is facilitated by a `RecordCommand`.
It supports editing the records of a `Patient` to match the user input. `RecordCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

The edit records mechanism functions like that of the `EditCommand`. It searches for the patient to be edited and the record to be edited based on the indexes provided
by the user. It then creates a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, changing the records attribute to
match the user input. The `RecordCommand` then calls for the utility method `updatePerson` under `Model`, to replace the patient to be
edited with the edited patient.

The inputs from the user are handled in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
private void closeWindow(String date, String symptom, String illness, String treatment) {
        if (date.equals("") || symptom.equals("") || illness.equals("") || treatment.equals("")) {
            messageText.setText("Please fill in all fields.");
        } else {
            if (RecordManager.authenticate(date, symptom, illness, treatment)) {
                messageText.setText("Success! Please close this window.");
                closeButtonAction();
            } else {
                if (!DateOfBirth.isValidDob(date)) {
                    messageText.setText("Date should only contain digits and"
                            + "slashes, in the following format DD/MM/YYYY");
                } else {
                    messageText.setText("Text field should only contain"
                            + "visible characters and spaces, and it should not be blank");
                }
            }
        }
    }
----

The `editedPatient` is created in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Patient> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (patientIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        patientToEdit = lastShownList.get(patientIndex.getZeroBased());

        //creating medical record window here and obtaining user input
        if (!isTest) { //only execute if it is not a test
            RecordWindow recordWindow = new RecordWindow();
            Stage stage = new Stage();
            recordWindow.start(stage, patientToEdit.getRecord(recordIndex.getZeroBased()));
        }

        Record editedRecord = RecordManager.getRecord();

        if (editedRecord == null) {
            editedPatient = patientToEdit;
        } else {
            editedPatient = createEditedPatient(patientToEdit, recordIndex.getZeroBased(), editedRecord);
        }
    }
----


Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The current patient queue is shown in Figure 29 below.

.The current queue
image::Figure 3.5.1.1.png[width="800"]

The user now decides to edit the first record of the first person in the list. Upon entering the command, a new window will pop up with each field displaying the
details of the patient's current record as shown in Figure 30 below.

.The medical record window
image::Figure 3.5.1.2.png[width="800"]

After the user hits the enter button or clicks on the confirm button, `RecordCommand` will search for the first person in the list and store it as the person to be edited.
`RecordCommand` will then create a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, except for the first record
which will be edited based on the user's input into the medical record window. This new patient will be stored as the edited patient as shown in Figure 31 below.

.The patient before and after editing
image::Figure 3.5.1.3.png[width="800"]

`RecordCommand` will finally call the for the utility method `updatePerson` under `Model`, to replace the patient to be edited with the edited patient,
the new list will be as shown in Figure 32 below.

.The queue with updated details
image::Figure 3.5.1.4.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RecordCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a duplicate `Patient` and utilise `updatePerson` to replace the `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a public method in `Record` for updating the record which will be called by `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new patient object).
** Cons: Will require public access to `Record` stored in `Patient` (possible security concerns).

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the record command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `RecordList` that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to understand for new developers as it follows existing structures.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. May be complex as `RecordList` then stores `Record`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a String that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new record object).
** Cons: Will require a method in Patient to update and verify validity of record. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and
Separation of Concerns as `Patient` now needs to do two different things.

===== Aspect: Implementation of medical record entries

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new window to display the details of the existing medical record
** Pros:
*** Will allow the user to view the rest of the system while typing into the medical record window.
*** Will allow the user to have a larger field so that they can check for mistakes in a glance.
** Cons:
*** May introduce confusion due to  additional window being created.
*** May result in slow speed and memory issues due to  additional window being created.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to type in full medical record information in the command
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new window).
** Cons: Will require user to key in the whole medical record in one go (not feasible).
// end::record[]

// tag::login[]
=== Login system feature
==== Current Implementation
The action of logging into IMDB is facilitated by `LoginCommand` and the static class `LoginManager`, which also contains a static attribute of class `LoginState`.

The static class `LoginManager` is implemented by a final class as follows:

[source,java]
----

public final class LoginManager {
    private static LoginState currLoginState = new LoginState(NO_USER_STATE, NO_USER_STRING);
    private static String passwordPath = "/data/passwords.csv";

    private LoginManager() {
            currLoginState = new LoginState(NO_USER_STATE, NO_USER_STRING);
    }

    public static boolean authenticate (String username, String password) {
        // Check if username and password match and are in the passwords list and updates currLoginState
    }

----

`LoginCommand` takes in username and password input from the user, then calls the static class `LoginManager` to authenticate the given username and password, meaning that it will check through a csv file of correct usernames and passwords. If the given username and password are found in that file, then the value stored in `LoginState` will be changed to reflect the role of the user who logged in (doctor or medical staff).

If `LoginState` shows that no user is currently logged in, certain commands that access the database such as `AddCommand` and `ListCommand` will throw an exception telling the user to log in. Once logged in, the user can perform those commands.

There is no need for a logout command, since `ExitCommand` can be used to exit the application, and when the application is opened again, `LoginState` will be reset.

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `LoginState`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a static `LoginManager` class with a static `LoginState` attribute
** Pros: Will allow the methods of `LoginManager` can be called anywhere, and its stored `LoginState` attribute will not be changed except through the authenticate method.
** Cons: Must implement the class as a final class with a private constructor, since Java does not support public static classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Store a login state in LoginCommand
** Pros: Can store login state as an int instead of an object instance.
** Cons: Will require a method in LoginCommand to update login state and verify username and password. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `LoginCommand` now needs to do two different things. Also, there is a need to somehow pass the login state to IMDBParser.
// end::login[]

// tag::print[]
=== Print Medical Records
==== Current Implementation
When `PrintCommand` is called, an instance of `PrintFormatter` is created, and a reference to the target `Patient` is passed to it.

`PrintFormatter` retrieves medical records and other information of the `Patient`, then uses iText (an external library) to format and print the records on a PDF.

After the PDF is created, `PrintFormatter` will try to use an existing application to open it. If that fails, an exception is thrown.

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: File format of printed document
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Print records onto a PDF
** Pros: Will result in PDF files that are compatible across multiple platform. Also, PDFs cannot be altered without leaving an electronic footprint, so they are secure, which is important when there is confidential patient data.
** Cons: Will result in difficulty in writing to a pdf with basic Java methods, so an external library will have to be used.
* **Alternative 2:** Print records onto a txt file
** Pros: Will be easy to implement using basic Java methods.
** Cons: Will result in a visually unappealing document. Also, txt files do not support pictures, which might be needed in the future (e.g. for X-ray photos).
// end::print[]

// tag::displaydetails[]
=== Display patient details feature
==== Current Implementation

The displaying of patient details mechanism is managed by `SelectCommand`.
`SelectCommand` now shows the details of a patient rather than just a dummy page.
This is achieved by modifying the `loadPersonPage` method within `BrowserPanel` like so:

[source,java]
----

    public void loadPersonPage(Patient patient) {
        this.patient = patient;
        name.setText(patient.getName().fullName);
        nric.setText("NRIC: " + patient.getNric().value);
        phone.setText("Phone: " + patient.getPhone().value);
        address.setText("Address: " + patient.getAddress().value);
        dob.setText("Date of Birth: " + patient.getDob().value);
        bloodType.setText("Blood Type: " + patient.getBloodType().value);
        email.setText("Email: " + patient.getEmail().value);
        remark.setText("Remarks: " + patient.getRemark().value);
        recordList.setText("Records: " + patient.getRecordList().toString());

        initTagLabels(patient);
    }

----

The patient list also no longer displays all the details of patients for security reasons as well as to reduce clutter.

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `SelectCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify the loadPersonPage method in the browserPanel class to fetch and display patient details
** Pros: Will be secure as details are kept within the app.
** Cons: Will have to rewrite how MainWindow and BrowserPanel works.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a method to convert patient details to a html file, then simply load that html file using the existing functionality.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement as we simply need a method to convert patient details to a html file.
** Cons: Might be security issues as the html file is easily accessible from outside the app.
// end::displaydetails[]

=== Logging

This section details how we go about logging the application.

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

This section details the documentation process.

[NOTE]
For formatting, we chose asciidoc over Markdown because although asciidoc is a bit more complex than Markdown, it provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in Figure 33 below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
This section describes the types of tests you can do, how you can test, and how you can troubleshoot should tests fail.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 1st one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, you can do the following:

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 2: Using Gradle (non-headless)*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

*Method 3: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops
This section details the development process.

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, IMDB depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.

==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
