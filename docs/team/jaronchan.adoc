== PROJECT: Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers

---

== Overview
The Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) application for Social Workers is a desktop client used to help
social workers manage their day-to-day operations. By creating an easy to use command-line interface with graphical
elements, social workers can quickly manage their contacts (e.g. beneficiaries) as well as their
schedule (i.e. their calendar and daily schedule) from one central location efficiently via the command line.
In addition to a fully-featured address book and calendar through the use of command line input,
the client also allows for social workers to take session notes and attach them to their
beneficiaries, as well as generate an optimal route of their daily schedule to help organize their day.

On top of these features, a robust login system was implemented such that multiple users can securely
switch between different accounts and have distinct address books, session reports, and calendars
isolated from each other. Thus, not only does this allow for increased security, but it also
allows for multiple users to use the same application on the same system, which has the added
benefit of saving money as several people can share the same application on the same system
without affecting the data of another person.

The social worker is to interact with the application primarily through the command line. The GUI was created
using JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*: integrated *Map APIs* and added *Daily Scheduler*

** *Added the following UI controllers and FXML files*:
```
DailySchedulerPanel.fxml
MapPanel.fxml
PersonDetailsPanel.fxml
ScheduledEventCard.fxml
```
** *Added the following commands*:
```
switch [args..]
navigate [args..]
```
** What it does: The enhancement adds the functionality of maps to display relevant location markers and a compiled
daily schedule page that helps for route planning and task listing for the convenience of the social worker.
From the using the command line alone, the user is able to see the locations of beneficiaries, suggested directions
between scheduled events and display the events for the day.
*** Justification: This feature significantly improves the the user experience of the social worker as it bring together
vital information to be displayed all in one app. By including a map display with the particulars of the beneficiary, it
aids the social worker in planning their route for the day. Moreover, by including a separate daily scheduler feature,
the social worker need not plow through their calendar check their scheduled events, simply use the daily scheduler to view
events of a specific day and check the directions between locations. This feature allows for the social worker to easily
re-plan their day if needed as all the information of events are collated in this feature.
*** Highlights: These features greatly improves the effectiveness of the application and laid the foundation for many events
and UIs within the application. To maintain architectural integrity of the application where the UI is kept separate and
is built to be events-driven, the Map Components had to be broken down into UI and Logic, where MapPanel.java controller
and MapManager.java that handles logic were created respectively. Moreover, there was a need to work around existing
limitations of GMapsFX where no more than one map can interact with Google APIs at the same time.

*Minor enhancement*: Main GUI and CSS. Handled front-end interactions with user and the view of the application. Developing
the backend of the application is not enough to produce an effective product. Building upon the back-end laid out by my teammates,
I built GUI of the application to manage model data of the application. Apart from map controls already mentioned, I took charge
of displaying session logs, scheduled events, creating additional UI update events on existing commands. Handled the refreshing of
UI when logging out of the application. Made the user flow smoother by separating the features into their own panels and implemented,
`switch` command to swap between features. Additional CSS styling can be found in `extensions.css`.
