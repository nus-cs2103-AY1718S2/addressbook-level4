== Introduction

=== What is Bibliotek

Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast and easy to use.
You can use Bibliotek to search for books, manage your reading list and track the availability of your books.

If you *prefer to use a desktop app*, like *working with a Command Line Interface* (<<cli, CLI>>)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (<<gui, GUI>>) or *can type fast*, Bibliotek is just for you!

Interested? Jump to <<Installing Bibliotek>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== Using this guide
This document is a reference for installing and using Bibliotek.
It can be accessed using the `help` command in the application.

=== Features and Capabilities
Below are some features and capabilities that Bibliotek supports:

* Search online for new books
* Track the books you are reading, have read, and want to read
* View book reviews
* View availability of books in the library
* Undo your previous actions

== Installing Bibliotek

Follow the steps below to get Bibliotek up and running on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
If you are unsure how to check the Java version on your computer, do check out https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml[this link]. +
To download the latest Java 8 version, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[click here].
+
.  Download the latest `bibliotek.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Bibliotek. +
[TIP]
The home folder is where the app and its data will be stored. +
We recommend placing Bibliotek in a folder of its own, to prevent any disorganization or clutter caused by data files.
.  Double-click on `bibliotek.jar` to start the app. The <<gui, GUI>>, similar to that shown below, should appear in a few seconds.
+

== Navigating Bibliotek

The interface of Bibliotek can be broken down into 4 main components.

. Just below the menu bar, there is a text box which says `Enter command here...`. This is where you type commands that you wish to execute. +
+
image::CommandBox.png[width="700"]
+
To get started, try typing `search Harry Potter` in this text box and press kbd:[Enter].
. Below this text box, there is a region which shows text. Responses to your commands can be found here. +
+
image::ResultBox.png[width="700"]
+
If you performed the search, you will realise that this region currently displays some message indicating that your search is in progress, successful or unsuccessful.
. The left panel displays a list of books, which is the result of your `search` command. These books are identified by their position in the list (given beside the book title). +
+
image::LeftPanel.png[width="250"]
+
Try interacting with the list by clicking on any book.
. The right panel displays additional information about books which you ask for. +
+
image::RightPanel.png[width="500"]
+
When you click on books, more detailed information is shown in the right panel, such as the book description.

To help you get accustomed to Bibliotek, here are some other commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all books
* **`add 1`** : adds the 1st book shown in the current list to your book shelf
* **`delete 3`** : deletes the 3rd book shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Command-Format]]
== Command Format

This section contains information about the general format of our commands and how they are represented in this documentation.
If you are new to Bibliotek, do take some time to read this section so that <<Features>> will make sense to you.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you supply e.g. in `search t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which you can use as `search t/Harry Potter`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g you can use `[t/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR]` as `t/Harry Potter a/Rowling` or as `t/Harry Potter` (but there cannot be no parameters).
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. For example, you can use `[a/AUTHOR]...` as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `a/Dubner`, `a/Dubner a/Steven Levitt`, etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. For example, if the command specifies `a/AUTHOR t/TITLE`, `t/TITLE a/AUTHOR` is acceptable.

When your search results are ready, Bibliotek shows `Found xx matching books.` and displays your
search results in the left panel.

image::SearchCommandFound.png[width="650"]

NOTE: If Bibliotek shows `Failed to retrieve information from online.`, it means your search request has timed out.
You should try again after some time.

Other examples:

* `RATING` must be a valid rating from 0 to 5, or -1, to select unrated books.
* `SORT_BY` must be one of the following:

[options="header",]
|==================================================================
|To sort by ... |Sort Mode |Aliases
|Title (ascending) |`titleA` |`tA`, `title`, `t`
|Title (descending) |`titleD` |`tD`

Within books of the same status, they will be sorted by priority (ordered by `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `NONE`). Finally, within books of the same priority, they will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their titles.
* If no constraints are provided, all books will be listed.
****

If you want to view all books in your book shelf, you can simply enter `list`.

Bibliotek shows `Listed xx books.` to indicate that the command was successful.

****

WARNING: You can only edit books from your book shelf.

Suppose you have a few unread books in your book shelf.

image::EditCommandStart.png[width="650"]

You may want to differentiate them based on how eager you are to read each book.
This helps you to better keep track of what you plan to read next, and also allows you to view the books in a more useful order. +
For example, if you feel that reading `Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins` is more urgent than reading the other books, you can change its priority to high using `edit 3 p/high`.

Bibliotek shows `Edited Book: TITLE - Authors: AUTHORS` to indicate that the `edit` was successful.
In the left panel, you can see that the priority label of `Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins` is changed to `High`.

* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

WARNING: You can only perform `delete` if the list shown is from your book shelf.

TIP: You don't have to delete books after reading them. Simply mark them as read.
They may serve as useful reference in the future.

Suppose you have the following books in your book shelf.

image::ListCommand.png[width="650"]

If you no longer want to read `Artificial Intelligence` and wish to remove it from your book shelf, enter `delete 3`.

Bibliotek shows `Deleted Book: TITLE - Authors: AUTHORS` to indicate that your `delete` is successful.

Once the data is ready, Bibliotek shows `Showing availability of book: TITLE - Authors: AUTHORS`.
The availability of the book in the library will show up in the right panel shortly after, as shown below.

NOTE: You can only interact with (e.g. scroll) the right panel when loading is fully completed.

TIP: In the event that loading isn't completed after a long time, you should try the command again.

image::LibraryCommandAfter.png[width="650"]

it means your search request has timed out. You should try again after some time.
// end::library[]

[[exit-command]]
=== Closing the app : `exit`

If you want to close the app, use `exit`. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

This section documents features that will provide you greater ease and convenience when using Bibliotek.

[[recent-command]]
// tag::recent[]
=== Listing recently viewed books : `recent` _(since v1.2)_

You recently selected a book in one of your searches but did not add it into your
book shelf, and now you have trouble searching up that book again? No worries, `recent`
is designed to take care of this. +
Format: `recent`

****
* Lists the books you recently selected in reverse chronological order.
* Limited to the last 50 books.
****

[NOTE]
====
You can select books in the `recent` list, but this will not count as a newest selection.
====

Suppose you recently selected `The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter` in your search results.

image::SelectCommand.png[width="650"]

You did not add the book into your book shelf. After performing various other selections,
you regret not adding `The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter` into your book shelf. Instead of
performing the search again, you can enter `recent` to view recently selected books.

Bibliotek shows `Listed xx recently selected books.` to indicate that your `recent` command
is successful. You can scroll down the left panel to locate `The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter`
(index 7 in this case).

image::RecentCommand.png[width="650"]

You can then enter `add 7` to add the book into your book shelf.

NOTE: If you don't see the intended book in the list, then too many book selections have been performed after
that book.
// end::recent[]

[[undo-command]]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

If you regret executing a command, use `undo` to reverse your action. +
Format: `undo`

****
* Restores the book shelf to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed.
****

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands are commands that modify the book shelf's content (`add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `clear`).
====

Suppose you just deleted a book `Harry Potter and the Classical World`.

image::DeleteCommand.png[width="650"]

If you regret your deletion and wish to undo it, enter `undo`.

Bibliotek shows `Successfully undone deleting of TITLE - Authors: AUTHORS.`
to indicate that your `undo` of the deletion is successful. `Artificial Intelligence` is back in your book shelf as seen in the left panel.

image::UndoCommand.png[width="650"]

NOTE: Your entire book shelf is shown in the left panel after performing `undo`.

Other examples:

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

[[history-command]]

****

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::alias[]
[[addalias-command]]
=== Adding a command alias : `addalias` _(since v1.5)_

If there is a command that you use frequently, and you find typing out the entire command to be too tedious,
you can add a command alias to reduce the amount of typing needed. +
Format: `addalias ALIAS_NAME cmd/COMMAND`

****
* Adds a command alias for the specified `COMMAND`.
* `COMMAND` should refer to a default, built-in command, and can optionally include command parameters.
* `ALIAS_NAME` is case-insensitive, and must not contain any spaces or tabs.
* If there is an existing alias with the same name as `ALIAS_NAME`, the existing alias will be overwritten.
****

WARNING: If `COMMAND` does not specify a valid built-in command, you will
get an `Unknown command` message when you attempt to use the command alias.

[TIP]
You can use command aliases to specify default named parameters (parameters with a prefix, such as `t/TITLE`). +
For example, if you want a custom `list` command that sorts by rating by default,
you can add a command alias using `addalias ls cmd/list by/rating`. +
You can override this default sort mode by specifying a different sort mode, e.g. `ls by/status`.

Examples:

* `addalias rm cmd/delete` +
Adds a command alias with the name `rm`. +
You can then use `rm INDEX` in place of `delete INDEX`.

* `addalias read cmd/edit s/read p/none` +
Adds a command alias with the name `read`. +
You can then use `read INDEX` in place of `edit INDEX s/read p/none`.

[[aliases-command]]
=== Listing command aliases : `aliases` _(since v1.5)_

If you have forgotten some of your command aliases and need a quick refresher, you can use
the `aliases` command to view them. +
Format: `aliases`

****
* Lists all command aliases.
****

After entering the `aliases` command, Bibliotek shows `Listed xx aliases.` to indicate that the command was successful.
The right panel will display a list of all your command aliases.

image::AliasesCommand.png[width="650"]

[[deletealias-command]]
=== Delete a command alias : `deletealias` _(since v1.5)_

If you no longer require a command alias, you can remove it using `deletealias`. +
Format: `deletealias ALIAS_NAME`

****
* Deletes the command alias specified by the `ALIAS_NAME`.
* `ALIAS_NAME` is case-insensitive, and must match the name of an existing alias.
****

Examples:

* `deletealias rm` +
Deletes the command alias with the name `rm`.
* `deletealias read` +
Deletes the command alias with the name `read`.
// end::alias[]

=== Hint system _(since v1.5)_
We understand that Bibliotek has many commands and it is difficult to remember the syntax of every command. With the hint system,
you can reduce the burden on your memory and count on Bibliotek to remind you instead!

****
* Provides hints on the syntax of commands based on the command word and/or parameters that you typed.
* Distinguishes between valid and invalid commands using black and red text color respectively.
****

Simply type the command word to view hints about the parameters that the command takes in.

image::HintSystem.png[width="650"]

You can also see whether your command is valid, and if it isn't, what parameter should come next.

image::HintSystemNextParameter.png[width="650"]

=== Command autocorrection _(since v1.5)_

It is common to mispell words when you are typing fast, and when this happens, it is always a hassle to have to correct it and try again.
With the command autocorrection system, this may only be one keypress away.

****
* Corrects mispelled command words which are one letter away from an actual command word, and suggests the correction to you.
* Corrects to alias names too.
* You can execute the corrected command by pressing kbd:[Enter].
****

If you accidentally typed `delte 1` instead of `delete 1`, there is no need to deliberately go back and correct it. Instead, you could just hit kbd:[Enter].

Bibliotek attempts to correct your command, and if successful, you will see a message `Did you mean: COMMAND ...`.

image::CommandAutocorrection.png[width="650"]

Press kbd:[Enter] if the shown `COMMAND` was indeed what you meant to type. The `COMMAND` will be executed as per normal.

WARNING: If you have aliases with closely matching names, the accuracy of the autocorrection system will degrade.

== Other Features

This section documents some additional features in Bibliotek that do not fall into the above categories.

// tag::quoteOfTheDay[]
=== Displaying quote of the day

When the right panel is empty (e.g. on start up), Bibliotek displays a default panel containing a random quote of the day about books.
// end::quoteOfTheDay[]

[[theme-command]]
=== Changing theme : `theme` _(since v1.2)_

If you don't like the default theme used by Bibliotek, you can change it using `theme`. +
Format: `theme THEME_NAME`

****
* `THEME_NAME` must specify a valid theme, and is case-insensitive.
* The current available themes are: `white`, `light`, and `dark`.
* The default theme is `white`
****

You can change the application to the white theme using `theme white`.

Bibliotek shows `Application theme changed to: white` to indicate that your theme change is successful.

image::ThemeWhite.png[width="650"]

The same goes for `theme light`:

image::ThemeLight.png[width="650"]

And `theme dark`:

image::ThemeDark.png[width="650"]

// tag::encrypt[]
[[setpw-command]]
=== Changing/Setting a password : `setpw` _(since v1.5)_

If you want to keep your data secure, you can opt to set a password for Bibliotek. This password will be used to encrypt your data.
After starting up Bibliotek, you will have to unlock it using your password before being able to perform any commands. +
Format: `setpw [old/OLD_PASSWORD] [new/NEW_PASSWORD]`

****
* Changes the password from `OLD_PASSWORD` to `NEW_PASSWORD`.
* `OLD_PASSWORD` and `NEW_PASSWORD` are case sensitive.
* At least one of the 2 fields must be provided.
* By default, there is no password.
****

NOTE: To set a password, use `setpw new/NEW_PASSWORD`. +
Similarly, to delete the password, use `setpw old/OLD_PASSWORD`.

If the `OLD_PASSWORD` that you provided is correct, Bibliotek shows `Successfully changed your password` to indicate that your password is changed.

image::setpassword1.png[width="650"]

On the other hand, if the `OLD_PASSWORD` that you provided is incorrect, Bibliotek shows `Incorrect old password. Please try again.` to indicate that your password is not changed.

image::setpassword2.png[width="650"]

NOTE: If you provide a `OLD_PASSWORD` when you in fact have no password, it is considered to be incorrect.

TIP: You should remember your password after setting a new one.

[[Lock-command]]
=== Locking the app : `lock` _(since v1.5)_

If you are going away for a moment and want to prevent others from messing with the application, you can perform `lock`. +
Format: `lock`

****
* Locks the app. No commands can be performed other than `help` and `unlock`.
* The app is locked upon start up if you have a password.
****

NOTE: If you perform `lock` without a password, anyone can `unlock` your application.

When you perform `lock`, Bibliotek responds with `Successfully locked the app.` to indicate that your `lock` is successful.
