.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
. Ensure that you have access to the internet.
.  Download the latest `et-employeestracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your E.T.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The user interface should appear in a few seconds, as shown in _Figure 1_.

[NOTE]
The above instructions are only for first-time users. However, because E.T. is locked by default for security purposes, you will need to follow step 4, 5, 6 for every time you open E.T. in the future. Of course, if you have changed your password, then you will need to execute step 6 with your new password.

After setting up, you can start using E.T. by typing commands and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

****
Some example commands you can try:

* `list` +
lists all employees.
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` +
adds an employee named `John Doe` to E.T.
* `delete 3` +

* `exit` +

****
Refer to <<Commands>> for more details on commands.

=== Knowing the User Interface

The User Interface will be the application’s interface that you will interact with. E.T. has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of a Command Line Interface (CLI).

_Figure 5_ shows the 5 major components of the GUI of E.T. :

* *Command Box*: where you type in commands.
* *Result Display Box*: where E.T. shows text result to you.
* *Employees List Panel*: where the list of all employees is shown.
* *Employee's Profile Panel*: where the details of the selected employee is shown.
* *Notification cards*: where E.T. reminds you about events.


.Graphical User Interface (GUI).
image::UiLabelled.png[width="800"]


=== Reading the result display box

The result display box shows 3 types of information:

* Error messages in [red]#red# if the command you entered does not exists or does not match the pre-defined format.
* Hints about the format and usage of the command in [maroon]#maroon#.
* Status of E.T. in [maroon]#maroon# if your command is processed successfully.

[NOTE]
Whenever you type keyword of a command in the `Command Box`, E.T. will provide [maroon]#hints# about its usage.
// tag::quickStart[]


=== Understanding the notifications
E.T. has a 2 phase notification system, i.e. there will be 2 notification cards popping up to remind you of each event:

* The first phase notification will pop out in a [blue]#blue# notification card, on the day of expiry, as shown in _Figure 6_.
* The second phase notification will pop out in a [red]#red# notification card, at the exact time of expiry, as shown in _Figure 7_.

.First phase notification card.
image::card_blue.png[width=""]

.Second phase notification card.
image::card_red.png[width=""]

For example, suppose you have assigned a task to Jane which will due on 15^th^ Apr 2018 0032 hrs. When you open E.T. for the first time in the morning of 15^th^ Apr 2018, you will be notified that Jane has a task that will due on *today* in a [blue]#blue# notification card. Later at 0032 hrs of 15^th^ Apr 2018, you will receive the second phase notification in [red]#red#, informing you that Jane should have finished the task by *now*.

Notification cards will disappear from the screen after 5 seconds and will be stored in the `Notification Center`. If you want to refer to them later, use `noti` command or double press kbd:[Shift] to open the `Notification Center`.

Also, if you minimizes E.T. to use other software, E.T. is capable of showing notification cards in your computer's system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), as shown in _Figure 8_. However, this feature may not work on some computer systems.

.E.T. shows notification card about event expiry even if you are using other programs.
