== PROJECT: CLIndar

---

== Overview

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their schedules.
The application deals with 2 types of entries:

* tasks: things that need to be done by a certain deadline; and
* events: things that occur at a specific time and place.

CLIndar is *Common-Line Interface (CLI)-based and uses Linux-style commands*, which computing students are familiar with.
It also has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to manage storage of tasks and events.*
** What it does:
*** *automatically saves* data after each update;
*** *automatically loads* latest data upon launching of application;
*** allows the user to *export* data into an xml file; and
*** allows the user to *import* data from an xml file.

** Justification: This enhancement improves the product significantly because:
*** the automatic saving and loading allow the user to *view his/her latest tasks and events*; and
*** the export and import features allow the user to *move their data (in the form of an xml file) from one computer to another* (e.g. through e-mail or thumb drive). +

** Highlights: This enhancement requires new association between 2 major components (Logic and Storage) that were previously only indirectly related.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes at different levels of abstraction.
** Credits: This enhancement makes use of and enhances existing code written by previous developers, that deals with reading data from and saving data to an xml file.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an automatic sorting feature that allows the entries to be sorted by date/time every time a new entry is added.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B3/main/blob/master/collated/functional/karenfrilya97.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/karenfrilya97.md[Test code]]
