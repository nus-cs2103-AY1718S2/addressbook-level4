== Introduction

AddSurance is targeted at insurance agents who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts with current or potential clients*.
It allows insurance agents to manage a huge list of contacts in batches, as well as keep track of appointments with clients.
More importantly, AddSurance is *optimized for insurance agents who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AddSurance can get your contact management tasks done faster
than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

* _No need_ to include quotations ("...") around the file path

[Note]
*The `.csv` file from which you are importing the contacts should:*

//tag:export[]
==== Exporting contacts to CSV: `export_contacts` or `ec`

Export all contacts to a .csv file.

Format: `ec f/PATH`

[NOTE]
It is not necessary to include a file path after the command. If no file path is included, `ec` will create and write to a new .csv file, _data/exportToExisting.csv_. This is necessary for testing purposes, so we encourage the user to specify a file path.


****
* Be sure to include .csv at the end of the file name
* No need to put the file path in quotes ("..."), can simply write it directly
* Can write absolute or local file path
* You may also give the path to a file name that doesn't yet exist. For example, you may call `ec data/newFileExample.csv` where `data/newFileExample.csv` does not yet exist. In this case, a new .csv file will be automatically created and written to.
