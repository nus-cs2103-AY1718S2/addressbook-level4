== Introduction

PrioriTask is a desktop task management application. It is not just any task management application, but a combination of the to-do list, calendar and reminder features, with an added bonus of an automatic updating and sorting of your tasks based on priority levels. It helps you keep track of your tasks, while providing you with at-a-glance views of upcoming tasks by day, week or month. PrioriTask is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With PrioriTask, you can:

- Keep track of your tasks and their deadlines, with reminders of approaching deadlines and at-a-glance views of upcoming tasks by day, week or month.
- Manage your tasks' priorities with our automatic updating and sorting feature, so that you will never have to worry about deciding which task to start working on.
- Maintain your list of tasks effectively with our easy-to-remember and user-friendly commands, which can help you get your tasks organised faster than traditional GUI applications.

PrioriTask is a CLI application. All features are executed primarily via the command box.

In the following sections, you will be introduced to several commands and their command formats. Here are a few things to take note of:

* The command word and alias are case-sensitive.
** icon:check[] Typing `help` executes the command.
** icon:times[] Typing `Help`, `heLp` or `HELP` does not execute the command.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
** E.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/CS2103T Developer Guide`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
** E.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/CS2103T Developer Guide t/CS2103` or as `n/CS2103T Developer Guide`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
** E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), or `t/CS2103`, `t/CS2103 t/CS2101` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.
** E.g. If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PRIORITY_LEVEL`, `p/PRIORITY_LEVEL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
