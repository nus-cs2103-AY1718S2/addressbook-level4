== PROJECT: Fastis - MeetUp Manager

---

== Overview

Fastis is a desktop application that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively. The application enables students to keep track of group membersâ€™ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos and schedule suitable meetup time.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the to-do list*
** What it does: allows the user to add to-dos and manage the to-dos with various commands: check/uncheck to-dos as done/undone, edit content of to-dos and delete to-dos. The percentage of completed to-dos is shown with a pie chart.
** Justification: This feature helps the user keep track of deliverable and agendas in group meetings, which aims to improve team management.
** Highlights: This enhancement makes the application be more customised and focused towards group meetings. It required an in-depth understanding of the four main components of Fastis, which are `Model`, `UI`, `Logic` and `Storage`.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a detail field for a person, which displays additional information and remark for the person.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/tree/master/collated/functional/nhatquang3112.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/nhatquang3112.md[Test code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
*** Managed weekly milestones on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage

=== Add ToDo feature

Adds a to-do.

==== Current implementation

The add to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `AddToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding ToDo objects to the address book. AddToDoCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddToDoCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddToDoCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... add to-do logic ...
    }
}
----

The to-dos in the to-do list are facilitated by `ToDo` class. Each `ToDo` object have a `Content` object and a `Status` object, representing the content and status of the to-do.
Address book stores all to-dos in `UniqueToDoList`.
`ToDo`,`Content` and `UniqueToDoList` class reside inside `AddressBook`. <<fig43,Figure 43>> is the class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content`, `Status`, `UniqueToDoList` and `AddressBook`:
[[fig43]]
.Class Diagram for UniqueToDoList.

On a smaller scale, <<fig44, Figure 44>> is a class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content` and `Status`:

[[fig44]]
.Class Diagram for To-Do.
image::ToDoStatusContentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UniqueToDoList` in the address book will be empty if no to-dos have been added previously.

The user executes a new `AddToDoCommand` with `Content`, to add a new to-do to the address book.
The `Status` of the to-do is "undone" by default.
The new to-do with content and status is added to the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig45, Figure 45>> shows how the addToDo operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restrict the constructor of ToDo to be ToDo(Content content, Status status)`
** Pros: This implementation allows ToDo class to be easier to maintain and debug.
** Cons: This implementation requires extensive refactor of existing tests.
// end::addToDo[]

// tag::checkToDo[]
=== Check/UnCheck ToDo feature

Checks or unchecks a To-do

==== Current implementation

The check/uncheck to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Status objects within ToDo objects. CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

Similar to `Content` object, each `ToDo` object have a `Status` object, representing the status of the to-do.
The status of a to-do can be either `done` or `undone`.

When user check/uncheck an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the existing `ToDo`'s `Content` and appropriate new `Status`.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig46, Figure 46>> shows how the checkToDo operation works:

<<fig47, Figure 47>> shows how the unCheckToDo operation works:
[[fig47]]
.Sequence Diagram for unCheckToDo.
image::UnCheckToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setStatus(Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::checkToDo[]

// tag::editToDo[]
=== Edit ToDo feature

Edits a To-do.

==== Current implementation

The edit to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `EditToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Content objects within ToDo objects. EditToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, EditToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user edit an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the new `Content` and a new `Status` of "undone" value.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig48, Figure 48>> shows how the editToDo operation works:
[[fig48]]
.Sequence Diagram for EditToDo.
image::EditToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `EditToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setContentAndStatus(Content content, Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::editToDo[]

// tag::deleteToDo[]
=== Delete ToDo feature

Deletes a To-Do.

==== Current implementation

The delete to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting ToDo objects. DeleteToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user delete an existing to-do of specific `Index`, the `UniqueToDoList` within `AddressBook` is updated and stored in the `StorageManager`.
