== PROJECT: SellIT

---

== Overview

Sell IT is for salesmen who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their clients. More importantly, Sell IT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Sell IT can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the lock/unlock & reset password function*
** What it does: allows the user to lock the addressbook when he/she does not need to use it and unlock the addressbook with password when he/she needs to use it. And the user can also change the password when neccessary.
