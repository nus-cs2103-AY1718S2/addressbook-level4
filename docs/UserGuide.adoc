== Introduction

TeachConnect (TC) is created to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. TeachConnect is also tailored for teachers who would *prefer to use a Desktop App for managing contacts*. Most importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to enter input using keyboard* while still having the benefits of seeing the results on a screen. If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional contact books.


== About this guide

TC has many features at your disposal. This guide will help you learn and use the
various features available to utilise TC to its fullest potential. +
Don’t worry if you are not a computer geek, we will walk you through the simple steps to
become a TC master user! +
Let’s jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

There a few pre-requisites that you might need to install. This shouldn't take more than a few minutes. If you already have them installed, please move to <<Features>> to learn more about our features:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can download the latest Java version link:https://java.com/en/download/[here].
+
.  Download the latest `Teachconnect.jar` [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W14-B1/main/releases/tag/v1.5[here]].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TeachConnect.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The application screen should appear in a few seconds. For details of each component of the application, you can refer to <<UserInterface>>. `Figure 1` displays an example of the screen on loading the application.

And that's it! The setup is done! You can now:

* Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

** Some example commands you can try:


** *`list`* : lists all contacts.
** **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe`.
** **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
** *`exit`* : exits the app.


Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.


[[UserInterface]]
== User Interface
TeachConnect application screen consists of 5 major components: menu bar, command box, command result box, active list, and calendar view. `Figure 2` annotates the position of each component in the application screen.


image::GUIcomponents.jpg[width="800"]
    Figure 2: Position of various components

* Menu bar: +
Contains two options `File` and `Help`. `File` creates a drop down menu to exit the application. `Help` opens the help window if needed.

* Command box: +
Commands are entered here.

* Command result box: +
Shows result message upon execution of any input entered.

* Active List: +
Displays the full list of `contacts`, `students`, `appointments`, `tasks`, `classes` or `shortcuts` stored by TeachConnect. The active item list is selected by the last `list` command entered. The default list selected upon successful start up of TeachConnect is `contacts`. You can refer to <<List>> for more details. +
Item in the list is shown as a card with an index which can be used for `delete` or `edit` commands, together with their details. `Figure 3` shows the components of a typical card in the contacts list. A student marker on the top right corner of the card is used to distinguish students from other people.

Format 1: `export n/NAME r/RANGE [t/TAG] p/PATH te/TYPE`

Format 2: `export classes n/NAME p/PATH te/TYPE`

****
* Here `TYPE` refers to the kind of export you want to do.
* `TYPE` can be either excel or xml.
* `Name` should not be included in the path. There is also no need to give the extension of the file (.xml or .csv) as type of the file is already being given.
****

[TIP]
You can export all contacts, all contacts with a certain tag, all contacts in a range or all the contacts in a range with a certain tag in a single command. +
You can also choose to export it a .csv file which you can later open in Excel. +
You can also choose to export all the classes and the students in it using the export class format.

[WARNING]
You can only export all or people based on one or zero tags. +
Be careful about the parameter value for the format type. It has to exactly be either `xml` or `excel`.

Examples:

* `export n/StudentsFile1 r/all t/students p/{path to the current folder} te/xml` : +
Exports all contacts with tag student to an xml file named `StudentsFile1` to the folder given in the path.
* `export n/StudentsFile2 r/1,10 t/students p/{path to the current folder} te/excel` : +

You can also set shortcut for the shortcut command. +
You can always see the list of shortcuts you set using `list shortcuts` as shown in `Figure 13` given below.

image::ShortcutsList.png[width="800"]
    Figure 13: List of shortcuts stored

[WARNING]
You cannot set the shortcut word to be a already preregistered command. +
Your shortcut word cannot be more than a single word. +
