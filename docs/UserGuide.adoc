== Introduction

MoVie Planner is for cinema managers who *prefer to use a desktop application to manage cinemas' schedules*. More importantly, MVP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MVP can get your scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
