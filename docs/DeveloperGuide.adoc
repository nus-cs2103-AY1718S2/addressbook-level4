== Introduction

Employees Tracker is a *Human Resource Manager* application that helps managers to manage their subordinates. It has 2 main functionalities: providing information about employees, as well as helping in tracking the tasks assigned to each employee.

This developer guide serves to guide you so that you are able to develop Employees Tracker further and contribute to it.

== Setting Up

Make sure you follow this section carefully so that you get to work on Employees Tracker right away!

=== Prerequisites

Before you start developing, make sure you have the followings in your computer:

* *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Instructions for setting up the project in your computer

Follow the steps below to set up the project in your computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verification of the setup

Follow the steps below to verify your setup:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours.

To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: +
Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: +
Add a `<blank line>` between `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, and `import all other imports` each sequentially.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section outlines the design of Employees Tracker.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *Architecture Diagram* given in _Figure 1_ below explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram.
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Given below is a quick overview of each component:

* `Main` : It only has one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:
** At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
** At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.
* `Commons` : It represents a collection of classes used by other components. +
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
** `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> : It is the User Interface (UI) of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> : It executes command.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> : It holds Employees Tracker's data in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> : It communicates between Employees Tracker and hard disk to read and write data.

Each of the last four components (<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>, <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>, and <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>) shares a common functionality:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to the class diagram given in _Figure 2_ below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-driven nature of the design

The *Sequence Diagram* given in _Figure 3_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1).
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Pay attention to how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when Employees Tracker's data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The *Sequence Diagram* given in _Figure 4_ below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2).
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Pay attention to how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The *Class Diagram* given in _Figure 5_ below shows the classes in UI component and their associations.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`] for the *API* of UI Component.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component, binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change, and responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The *Class Diagram* given in _Figure 6_ below shows the classes in Logic component and their associations.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component.
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The *Class Diagram* given in _Figure 7_ below shows a finer detail concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in _Figure 6_.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`] for the *API* of Logic Component.

The `Logic` component uses the AddressBookParser class to parse the user command. This will result in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`, which may affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`

The *Sequence Diagram* given in _Figure 8_ below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component for `execute("delete 1")` _API_ call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command.
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The *Class Diagram* given in _Figure 9_ below shows the classes in Model component and their associations.

.Structure of the Model Component.
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`] for the *API* of Model Component.

The `Model` component does the following:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores Employees Tracker's data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

The `Model` component does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The *Class Diagram* given in _Figure 10_ below shows the classes in Storage component and their associations.

.Structure of the Storage Component.
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Storage.java[`Storage.java`] for the *API* of Storage Component.

The `Storage` component does the following:

* Save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Save Employees Tracker data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of Employees Tracker (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of Employees Tracker before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5^th^ person in Employees Tracker. The current state of Employees Tracker is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore Employees Tracker to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores Employees Tracker to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`.
** Pros: Will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`.
** Pros: Template pattern is not involved when developing, so it is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves entire Employees Tracker.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies Employees Tracker (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: Only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of Employees Tracker and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo.
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::rate[]
=== Edit and rate a person
This section presents the implmentation of `edit` command and `rate` command, which are implemented in a similar manner. The only difference is that `rate` can only change the `Rating` field, but `edit` can be used to change any field.

==== Current Implementation

There are 4 classes that play a vital role in the current implementation:

* Person
* EditCommandParser or RateCommandParser
* EditPersonDescriptor
* EditCommand

The following code snippet shows the fields of the `EditPersonDescriptor` class, which is an internal class of `EditCommand`.

[source, java]
----
  public static class EditPersonDescriptor {
        private Name name;
        private Phone phone;
        private Email email;
        private Address address;
        private Set<Tag> tags;
        private Set<Review> reviews;
        private Rating rating;
        private Photo photo;
  }
----
Note that the `EditPersonDescriptor` has the exact same fields as the `Person` class.
Each of the fields is used to contain the corresponding *new* value of the field. For example, suppose the user wants to edit the name from "Alek" to "Alex", "Alex" will be stored in the `name` field of `EditPersonDescriptor`. +

_Figure 11_ below shows the sequence diagram of the execution of `rate` command. `Edit` command has an exactly same execution, `RateCommandParser` will be replaced with `EditCommandParser` while `RateCommand` will be replaced with `EditCommand`.

.Sequence diagram of Rate Command execution
image::Rate Command Sequence Diagram.png[width="500"]

The important method calls during the execution of `edit` and `rate` command includes:

. parse(args): `EditCommandParser` extracts the new information for each field from user input.
. EditPersonDescriptor(): `EditPersonDescriptor` is used to record which field(s) will be changed and the respective new value.
. getFilteredPersonList(): The original Person, `toEdit` is obtained from `Model`.
. person(): `edited` Person will be created, by obtaining the new value for modified fields from `EditPersonDescriptor`. The value of unmodified field(s) are obtained from `toEdit`.
. updatePerson(toEdit, edited): `edited` Person is used to replace `toEdit` Person in `AddressBook`.

[NOTE]
This current implementation of `edit` command is by courtesy of the original AddressBook application. The W15B1 team is only responsible for adapting the implementation into `rate` command.

==== Design Considerations

This section showcases some of the alternative designs for the implementation of `rate` and `edit` command.

There are 2 ways to update information regarding a `Person` object. +

* Alternative 1 (current implementation): Creates a new `Person` object that contains the new information to replace the old `Person` object
** Pros: data integrity is guaranteed, higher cohesion (all modifications on data must be done through `Model`)
** Cons: implementation is more complicated
* Alternative 2: Uses setter methods on the `Person` object
** Pros: implementation is simple
** Cons: data integrity is compromised (the `Person` object can be modified by any entity), more coupling
// end::rate[]

// tag::emer7[]
=== Review feature

==== Current Implementation

A `Review` consists of the _review_ content itself and the _reviewer_. _Review_ and _reviewer_ are separated by a single newline character.

_Review_ content itself has no restriction on the content, it accepts all characters with no length limitation). _Reviewer_ must be a valid email format. A new empty `Review` will be instantiated with null value of `-` for both _review_ and _reviewer_, signifying that both fields are empty.

Each `Person` has a `UniqueReviewList`, that is a unique list of `Review(s)`. A new `Person` upon creation will have an empty `UniqueReviewList`. A `Person` can be assigned `Review(s)` through `review` command.

`review` command and `review` command are implemented in a similar manner. They both involve modifying the field(s) of a `Person`. The only difference is that `review` can only change the `Review` field, but `edit` can be used to change any field except `Review`. Hence, the implementation may be very similar to <<Edit and rate a person>>.

The implementation of `review` and `edit` command in the Logic component involves 4 objects: +

. `Person` personToEdit.
. `Person` editedPerson.
. `Parser` ReviewCommandParser.
. `EditPersonDescriptor`.

Since all fields of the `Person` class are immutable, we need to use `Person` _editedPerson_ to replace the `Person` _personToEdit_.

Additionally, the implementation also involves `ReviewDialog` in the UI component and `ShowReviewDialogEvent` in Common component to show the pop-up review dialog for user to input _reviewer_ and _review_.

The details of implementation are as follow:

. `Parser` extracts `Index` from user input and validates it.
. `Parser` posts `ShowReviewDialogEvent` to show the review pop-up dialog for user to input the _reviewer_ and _review_.
. `EditPersonDescriptor` is used to record the new `Review` value.
. `Person` _editedPerson_ will be created by obtaining the new `Review` value from `EditPersonDescriptor` together with the old `Review` value. +
The old `Review` value is obtained from `Person` _personToEdit_.
. `Person` _editedPerson_ is used to replace `Person` _personToEdit_ in `AddressBook`.

Given below in _Figure 11_ is the partial sequence diagram of Review Command. `LogicManager` and how `ReviewCommand` executes are omitted as they are similar to _Figure 8_.

.Sequence Diagram for Review Command
image::review_seq.png[width="800"]

[source,java]
----
public class ReviewCommandParser implements Parser<ReviewCommand> {

    public ReviewCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        // ... get Index from args and validates it to be positive
        // ... post events for the review dialog
        try {
            // ... create Review from the input from review dialog ...
            // ... create EditPersonDescriptor based on the Review ...
            return new ReviewCommand(index, editPersonDescriptor);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            // ... throw exception ...
        }
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void getReviewInput(ReviewInputEvent event) {
        // ... get reviewer and review content from the review dialog ...
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to get the review input from user

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use JavaFX's Dialog for a pop-up window.
** Pros: More comfortable and convenient for user to type longer review and also easier for them to edit.
** Cons: Harder to implement and user may not necessarily want a pop-up window.
* **Alternative 2:** Use CommandBox.
** Pros: Easier to implement and user can directly type to the CommandBox, which may be more efficient.
** Cons: May be restrictive for user to enter a long review or to edit what they have typed.

===== Aspect: Way of showing the review dialog

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Post an event to request MainWindow to show the Dialog.
** Pros: Good to comply with the Events-Driven nature of the application's design, making the design more cohesive and less coupling.
** Cons: Events-Driven design is routine-less. Need to put extra effort to control the events. As the application grows, there are more events posted
and it is necessary to control these events well to prevent events messing up.
* **Alternative 2:** Just add a static method in MainWindow that will show the Dialog.
** Pros: Simpler implementation than current one, no need extra effort for event controlling.
** Cons: The static method could not use the non-static attributes in MainWindow, as a result, need extra effort to deal with referencing non-static variables.

=== Calendars and operations on calendars
==== Current Implementation

To implement the calendars for employees, a third party source has been used which is Google Calendar API, it allows to manage google
calendars on desktop applications. The commands that relating to calendars are `addEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `todoList` and `authenET`.
Below is the overall design:

.Overall design relating to calendars.
image::calendarsystem.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Command `authenET` should be executed before all other commands if it is the first time to use E.T., because only when E.T. is authorized
with one working google account, all other commands can be executed correctly.

===== Implementation of `todoList` command

The logic flow of `todoList` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `todoList` command.
. `TodoListCommand` will firstly get the google calendar service through `Authentication`, then it will request google calendar service to retrieve all the events
on the main calendar. After that, it will post an event to request to open a todo-list window. And post another event containing all the retrieved events that are to be displayed.
. `UiManager` will handle the first event posted by `TodoListCommand` and show the `TodoListWindow`.
. `TodoListWindow` will handle the second event posted by `TodoListCommand` and display all the events.

Here is the code snippet of how `todoList` command executes:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() {
        // Build a new authorized API client service.
        com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar service =
                null;
        try {
            service = Authentication.getCalendarService();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        //retrieve events from the main calendar
        String calendarId = "primary";
        String pageToken = null;
        do {
            Events events = null;
            try {
                events = service.events().list(calendarId).setPageToken(pageToken).execute();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            List<Event> items = events.getItems();
            for (Event event : items) {
                eventList.add(new ListEvent(event.getSummary(), event.getLocation(), event.getStart().getDateTime()));
            }
            pageToken = events.getNextPageToken();
        } while (pageToken != null);
        //post events
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowTodoListEvent());
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowTodoListDisplayContentEvent(eventList));
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
----

As stated, `authenET` command is to be executed at the very beginning, and what it does is to sent a HTTP request through `Authentication` in order
to authorize E.T.. It will then receive a status code and a content page which will be opened by the default browser to ask the permission of authorizing E.T..

The implementation of  `addEvent` and `deleteEvent` commands are similar to `todoList` command, both require to first build a new authorized API calendar service.
Then they will just sent request through the API service and all other things will be done at google service side. Finally, they will do updates according to the request results.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Where to place the todo-list window
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make it as a pop-up window.
** Pros: Easy to manage, it is relatively independent to main window as it is created at a new javaFX stage.
** Cons: Cannot update information in pop-up windows, that is, if leave the todo-list window open and execute another `todoList` command, another todo-list
window will pop up which contains the most up-to-date information, then the two windows may cause confusion.
* **Alternative 2:** create a field called todo-list panel in `MainWindow`.
** Pros: Every time execute `todoList` command, the information can be updated, without creating new windows.
** Cons: Need to re-structure the layout of MainWindow.

===== Aspect: When and how to authorize E.T.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A dedicated command `authenET` to authorize E.T..
** Pros: Make the logic more clear and systematic.
** Cons: Single point of failure: if not execute `authenET` ahead, all other commands relating to calendars will not work.
* **Alternative 2 (old version):** Every command goes through the authorization step to check if authorized.
** Pros: No need extra command ahead, each command can execute independently.
** Cons: A lot of unnecessary authorization processes, because this step is supposed to be run only once and all are set. The
response time per command will be longer.

=== Lock and Unlock system
==== Current Implementation

The Lock and Unlock system is facilitated by maintaining a password inside `LogicManager` at runtime, and also maintaining
the password in storage when application is closed. It allows to lock the application (hiding information) while keeping the application
open, and unlock it to resume at anytime.

The password is stored in storage as a field annotated as `@XmlElement` in `XmlSerializableAddressBook`, and is been read and converted to model type when the application
is launched and kept at `LogicManager` in which the password can be handled at runtime.

Below is the overall design of Lock and Unlock system. Arrows are representing logic flow and lines in blue, red and green are for event posting and handling.

.Overall design of lock and unlock system.
image::lockunlocksystem.png[width="800"]

===== Implementation of `lock` command
The logic flow of `lock` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `lock` command.
. `LockCommandParser` is to make sure no other extra inputs are entered besides the command word `lock`.
. `LockCommand` is used to set the state of the application to be locked, and post an event to indicate the application is locked such that
no information should be shown now. Note the `DetailPanel` is the handler of the event. There are mainly two parts that need to be hidden: `PersonList` and `DetailPanel`. Refer to the first code snippet below.
. `LogicManager` is used to check the state and decide whether the application is locked or not, and decide the logic flow accordingly. Refer to the second code snippet below.

Below is the execution logic of `LockCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() {
    model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new HideDetailPanelEvent());
    LogicManager.lock();
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

Below is the logic flow in `LogicManger`:
[source,java]
----
    if (isLocked && !(command instanceof HelpCommand)) { //check if locked
        command.setData(model, history, undoRedoStack);
        if (command instanceof UnlockCommand) { //check unlock command
            UnlockCommand unlockCommand = (UnlockCommand) command;
            result = unlockCommand.execute();
        } else {
            result = new CommandResult("Addressbook has been locked, please unlock it first!");
        }
    } else { //unlocked case
        command.setData(model, history, undoRedoStack);
        result = command.execute();
        undoRedoStack.push(command);
    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows how `lock` command works:

[NOTE]
The event posted by LockCommand should firstly be reacted by `EventsCenter` and then handled by `DetailPanel`,
this step is removed for clearer viewing and without messing up the diagram.

.Sequence Diagram for Lock Command.
image::lock_seq.jpg[width="800"]

===== Implementation of `unlock` command

The logic flow of `unlock` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `unlock` command.
. `UnlockCommandParser` is to make sure no other extra inputs are entered besides the command word `unlock`. Similar to `LockCommandParser`.
. `UnlockCommand` is used to post an event requesting `MainWindow` to pop up a password input dialog.
. `MainWindow` will handle the event posted by `UnlockCommand` and show the password input dialog. Then it will post an event containing user entered password.
. `UnlockCommand` will then handle the event and get the password from the event, and compare it with the application's unlock password to decide whether the unlock process is successful. Refer to the code snippet below.
. `LogicManager` is used to decide whether the application is locked or not, and decide the logic flow accordingly.

Below is the execution logic of `UnlockCommand`:
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() {
        if (!LogicManager.isLocked()) {
            return new CommandResult("Employees Tracker is already unlocked!");
        }
        //post a event to show password input dialog.
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowPasswordFieldEvent());

        // if the password is set to "nopassword", means no input got from user.
        if (this.password.equals("nopassword")) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_MISSING_PASSWORD);
        }
        //check if the entered password match the unlock password.
        if (this.password.compareTo(LogicManager.getPassword()) == 0) {
            LogicManager.unLock();
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new AddressBookUnlockedEvent());
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_INCORRECT_PASSWORD);
        }
    }

    /**
    * handle the event to get the input password.
    */
    @Subscribe
    private void handlePasswordEnteredEvent(PasswordEnteredEvent event) {
        this.password = event.getPassword();
    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows how `unlock` command works:

[NOTE]
The detail of the instantiation of `UnlockCommand` is removed, because it is similar to that of
`LockCommand`. Note that both `MainWindow` and `UnlockCommand` are event handler, which is indicated by the two post method and the
blue activation bar in the diagram, and the interaction with `EventsCenter` is also omitted like before.

.Sequence Diagram for Unlock Command.
image::unlock_seq.jpg[width="800"]

===== Implementation of `setPassword` command

This command is used to set new unlock password of the application, which is also part of
the Lock and Unlock system. The implementation of `setPassword` command is similar to that of `unlock` command, but additionally,
`setPassword` command requires to update the password in both model and storage.

The logic flow of `setPassword` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `setPassword` command.
. `SetPasswordCommandParser` is to make sure no other extra inputs are entered besides the command word `setPassword`. Similar to `LockCommandParser`.
. `SetPasswordCommand` is used to post an event requesting `MainWindow` to pop up a password input dialog, get the passwords (old password and new password) entered by user, and
compare the old password with the application's current unlock password to decide whether they match. If match, then update the password in both `LogicManager` and storage. Refer to the code snippet below.
. `MainWindow` will handle the event and post another event containing user inputs, which is similar to that in `Unlock` command.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowSetPasswordDialogEvent());
        //check if all password input fields are inputed by user.
        if (!isComplete) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_INCOMPLETE_FIELD);
        }
        //check if the old password match the current one.
        if (this.oldPassword.compareTo(LogicManager.getPassword()) == 0) {
            LogicManager.setPassword(this.newPassword);
            model.setPassword(this.newPassword);
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_INCORRECT_OLDPASSWORD);
        }
    }
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to input password values
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Input all password in dialogs.
** Pros: It is more secure as all password inputs in dialogs can be invisible.
** Cons: Need the cooperation with UI to pop up the dialogs, which makes it harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2 (old version):** Just let the passwords be the command parameters.
** Pros: Easy to achieve as only need to parse the inputs in command parser to get the passwords.
** Cons: Not so secure, because the password inputs are all visible like the command word, and someone else may accidentally see them.

===== Aspect: Way of showing the password input dialog
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Post an event to request MainWindow to show the Dialog.
** Pros: Good to comply with the Events-Driven nature of the application's design, making the design more cohesive and less coupling.
** Cons: Events-Driven design is routine-less. Need to put extra effort to control the events. As the application grows, there are more events posted
and it is necessary to control these events well to prevent events messing up.
* **Alternative 2:** Just add a static method in MainWindow that will show the Dialog.
** Pros: Simpler implementation than current one, no need extra effort for event controlling.
** Cons: The static method could not use the non-static attributes in MainWindow, as a result, need extra effort to deal with referencing non-static variables.

===== Aspect: How to store the password in storage
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Password is a visible field in storage in plaintext.
** Pros: Easy to retrieve and update the password in storage.
** Cons: Not secure because password is visible in plaintext.
* **Alternative 2:** Password is still visible but encrypted.
** Pros: Though password is visible, it it encrypted and one can only get the correct password by getting the encryption key. It is more secure.
** Cons: Every time load the password from data, need to decrypt it and every time update it in storage, need to encrypt it.
Also need to keep the encryption key somewhere secret.

// tag::addphoto[]
=== Add photo to employees
==== Current Implementation

Command `addPhoto` mainly copy the local photo files chosen by users to the data folder of E.T., and employees will be assigned with these
photos which matches to their fields for photo.

The logic flow of `addPhoto` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `addPhoto` command.
. `AddPhotoCommandParser` is to make sure the user inputs are correct and extract the parameter.
. `AddPhotoCommand` is will first post an event requesting `MainWindow` to pop up a file chooser, get the photo file chose by user,
and check its validation. It will then copy this photo to the data folder if this photo does not exist there. Finally, it will update
person and pass to `ModelManager`.
. `ModelManager` will update the person list and the photo list accordingly.

Here is the class diagram of `addPhoto` command:

.Class diagram of `addPhoto` command.
image::addphotoclassdia.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to maintain the photos
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store them at application's data folder which can be retrieved at runtime.
** Pros: Easy to manage, as the photos are all in application's data folder.
** Cons: Need to maintain an extra list in runtime storage to manage the photos in data folder.
* **Alternative 2:** No need to store photos at application's data folder, load them directly from local disk.
** Pros: No need to maintain the list of photos in application.
** Cons: The change of photos' paths in local disk will cause loading error at runtime, need mechanisms to ensure person photo paths are
dynamically referenced.
// end::addphoto[]

// tag::exportcom[]
=== Export employees data

Command `export` will export employees data as a .csv file into data folder.

The logic flow of `addPhoto` command is:

. `AddressBookParser` is used to let the application accept `export` command.
. `ExportEmployeesCommand` is will first post an event to get the current employee list in `ModelManager`, and then create a .csv file
at data folder. It will finally write the employees' information to that file.

Here is the code snippet of the execution of `export` command:

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new GetEmployeesRequestEvent());
        File csv = new File(EXPORT_FILE_PATH);
        BufferedWriter bw = null;
        try {
            bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(csv));
            bw.write("Name,Phone,Email,Address,Tags\n");
            for (Person p : employees) {
                String temp = p.getName().fullName + "," + p.getPhone().value + "," + p.getEmail().value + ","
                        + p.getAddress().value.replaceAll(",", " ");
                if (!p.getTags().isEmpty()) {
                    temp = temp + "," + p.getTags().toString()
                            .replaceAll(", ", " | ");
                }
                temp = temp + "\n";
                bw.write(temp);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAIL);
        }
        try {
            bw.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }

// tag::ns[]



=== Notification System
This section discusses about the implementation of the notification feature of Employees Tracker.

[NOTE]
All usages of the word `Event` in this section refers to the class `com.google.api.services.calendar.model.Event`,
not to be confused with Event classes in commons package which will be referred in their full name,
e.g. BaseEvent, AddressBookChangedEvent.

==== Current Implementation
This section shows how the Notification System is implemented in the current version of ET.

===== Introduction
In the current implementation, the major classes and objects of the notification system includes:

* The `Notification` class that stores of essential information for each `Event`.
* The LinkedList of `Notification` in the `AddressBook` class that stores all `Notification` objects.
* The `NotificationCard` class, which is a graphical representation of `Notification`.
* The `Notification Center` class that stores all the `NotificationCard` objects.
* The `MainWindow` class that is involved in showing `NotificationCard` objects on the GUI.
* The `Model` class that initiates the add notifications and delete notifications operations.

Please refer to the class diagram below for the association between them.

.Class diagram of the Notification System
image::Notification System.png[width="500"]

===== Initialization of the Notification System

For every time the app starts, the following initialization operations will be carried out:

. `AddressBook` and LinkedList of `Notification` is read from storage.
. `MainWindow` is created.
. `MainWindow` creates a `NotificationCenter`.
. `MainWindow` passes the `NotificationCenter` to `Model` through `Logic`.

// end::ns[]

===== Add-Notification Operation

The following steps show how a Notification is added to the Notification System:

.  A `Notification` is created.
. `Model` to add the `Notification` into the `Notifications` list in `AddressBook`.
. `Model` raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` and `NotificationAddedEvent` after adding the Notification.
. `Storage` handles the `AddressBookChangedEvent` and saves the new list of Notifications.
. `Logic` handles the  `NotificationAddedEvent` and decides when to show the notification.
. When it is time to show the notification, `Logic` will request `Ui` to show a notification.
. `Ui` will instruct `MainWindow` to show a notification.
. `MainWindow` will create a `NotificationCard` and shows it to user on-screen.
. `MainWindow` will create another copy of the same `NotificationCard` and stores it in the `NotificationCenter`

===== Find-owner-name operation

[NOTE]
Each `Event` is assigned (and thus) to an employee. In the following discussions, we will use the phrase `owner` to refer to the employee who is assigned to the `Event`.

Note that the `Notification` class only contains a field called `ownerId` instead of the name, email, etc. of its `owner`.
The information of the owner of a notification is retrieved through the `findPersonById` mechanism.
The following are the details of the mechanism:

* `AddressBook` class has a `nextId` integer field.
* Whenever an employee is added, `addressBook` assigns the `nextId` to him and increment the `nextId` field.
* The `Person` class has an `id` field to store the id.
* When a `Notification` is created, it has a `ownerId` field that stores the `id` of its `owner`.
* To retrieve the owner of a `Notification`, call `findPersonById(ownerId)` to obtain the `Person` owner. Then, use getter methods to obtain relevant information.

===== Delete-notification operation

Delete-notification operation has a simpler implementation compared to Add-notification operation. Please refer to _Figure 19_ below for the flow of the operation.

.Activity Diagram for deleting notification
image::Delete Notification.png[width=""]

[NOTE]
====
* Deleting with `eventId` and *not* `deleteFromAddressBookOnly` is usally invoked by `deleteEvent` command.
* Deleting with `eventId` and `deleteFromAddressBookOnly` is usually invoked by `Logic`, when it is yet to add a `NotificationCard` to the `NotificationCenter` but finds out that the `owner` has already been deleted.
* Deleting with `eventId` is usually invoked by `delete` command, where `Notification` and `Person` are deleted together.
====

// tag::ns2[]
===== Add-notifications-at-startup operation

At each startup, after initializing the Notification System, ET will then go through the LinkedList of `Notification` in `AddressBook`.
For each `Notification` in the LinkedList, `NotificationAddedEvent` will be called.
That said, this may result in multiple threads attempting to make GUI operations at the same time through `MainWindow.showNewNotification`.
This will result in concurrent modification issues. Thus, `Semaphore` is used to prevent those issues. Please refer to the simplified code of `MainWindow.showNewNotification` at below.

[source, java]
====
  //current implementation only allows 1 thread to enter showNewNotification() at the same time.
  Semaphore = new Semaphore(1);
  /**
     * Show in-app notification
     */
    public void showNewNotification(ShowNotificationEvent event) {
        logger.info("Preparing in app notification");
        //...metadata update
        //hides notificationCard away from screen
        notificationCard.setTranslateX(NOTIFICATION_CARD_WIDTH);
        try {
            semaphore.acquire();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        notificationCard.setTranslateY(UP * shownNotificationCards.size() * NOTIFICATION_CARD_HEIGHT);
        shownNotificationCards.add(notificationCard);
        semaphore.release();
        //..animations
    }
====

==== Design Considerations
There are a couple of aspects with regards to `Notification` that can be implemented in alternative designs.

===== Aspect: extracting a Person's information
* **Alternative1 (current choice)**: `searchEmployeeById` mechanism.
** Pros: provides the latest information even if the `Person` is edited after the `Notification` is created.
** Cons: requires `id` field to be implemented in `Person` and `AddressBook` class, provides wrong information if `id` is not implemented correctly (e.g. repeated id).
* ** Alternative2**: storing the Person's Information in `Notification` class.
** Pros: has a simpler implementation.
** Cons: provides wrong information if `Person` 's information is edited after `Notification` is created, requires to update `Notification` when `Person` is edited, increases coupling.

===== Aspect: storing `Event` locally
* **Alternative1 (current choice)**: stores a list of `Notifications` in `AddressBook`.
** Pros: ensures that notification feature remains working when there's no internet access, saves storage space as only essential information is saved.
** Cons: has a complicated implementation (creation of `Notification` class and edit of `Person` and `AddressBook` class for `searchEmployeeById` mechanism).
* **Alternative2** : stores a list of `Event` in `AddressBook`.
** Pros: has a simpler implementation (doesn't need to implement `Notification` class).
** Cons: requires another mechanism for extracting `ownerName` because `Event` class does not store `ownerName`, waste of storage space because `Event` class contains a lot of information unnecessary for notification feature.
* **Alternative3** : stores a list of `Notifications` in `Person`.
** Pros: has a simpler implementation (doesn't need to implement `searchEmployeeById` mechanism).
** Cons: compromises performance, especially when there are a lot of employees and only a few `Notification`.
* **Alternative4** : does not store `Event` locally (relies on Google calendar service).
** Pros: has the simplest implementation (only need to pull data from Google, does not need to create local class), saves storage space as nothing is stored locally.
** Cons: compromises notification feature if there's no internet access, requires another mechanism for extracting `ownerName` because `Event` class does not store `ownerName`, compromises performance if internet speed is slow).
// end::ns2[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort existing employees
==== Current Implementation
The implementation of `sort` command involves following objects: +

. Command: SortCommand.
. Parser: SortCommandParser, AddressBookParser.
. AddressBook, UniqueEmployeeList.

The details of implementation of `sort` command are as follow:

. `SortCommandParser` guarantees Employees Tracker to accept `sort` command.
. `SortCommandParser` extracts the sorting field from user input.
. `ModelManager` and `UniqueEmployeeList` provide sorting algorithm, called by `AddressBook`.
. `UniqueEmployeeList` will sort the units by giving field.

Here is the sequence diagram of `sort` command:

.Sequence diagram of `sort` command.
image::SortCommandSeqDia.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of `SortCommand`
* **Alternative1(current choice)**: Sort the employees in `UniqueEmployeeList`.
** Pros: Easy to understand for new developers, and it is the most intuitive way of implementing.
** Cons: Will create different levels of abstraction of the same sort method in Model for sorting, which results to slightly more work.
* **Alternative2:** Create multiple `SortBy...` commands, use different comparators in these `SortBy...` commands.
** Pros: Easier for developer to implement, because sorting by different fields will be executed by different commands separately.
** Cons: Will raise a lot of redundant codes which can be extracted by Alternative1, and it is not user-friendly to let user treat "sorting by different fields" as different commands.

Here is the code snippet of the execution of `sort` command in `UniqueEmployeeList`:

[source,java]
----
    public void sort(String field) {
            switch (field) {
            case "name":
                sortByName();
                break;
            case "phone":
                sortByPhone();
                break;
            case "email":
                sortByEmail();
                break;
            case "address":
                sortByAddress();
                break;
            case "tag":
                sortByTag();
                break;
            case "rate":
                sortByRate();
                break;
            default:
                throw new AssertionError("Sort field should be name, phone, email, tag, address or rate.");
            }
        }
----
// end::sort[]

// tag::changeTheme[]
=== Change theme of Employees Tracker

`changeTheme` command is used to change the theme to `dark` or `bright`.

* `changeTheme` is achieved by handling `changeThemeEvent` in `MainWindow`.
* a new "theme" field is added in `GuiSetting`.
// end::changeTheme[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

== Documentation

This section outlines how to do the documentation for Employees Tracker.

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section outlines the testing procedure of Employees Tracker.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3^rd^ one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`.
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`.
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`.


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section outlines the development and operation of Employees Tracker.

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`.
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Employees Tracker depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in Employees Tracker, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in Employees Tracker.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your Employees Tracker application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever Employees Tracker is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving Employees Tracker to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves Employees Tracker after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for Employees Tracker storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that Employees Tracker can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
