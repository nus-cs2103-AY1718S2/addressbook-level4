== Introduction
//tag::overview[]
// comment: add a logo for flashy?
Flashy, lightning fast flashcard management.
// comment: better one liners?
[TIP]
====
What are flashcards? Traditionally, physical flashcards are actual cards that people use to help memorise things.
The front will have a question prompt and the back will have an answer.
====
// comment: Other ways to explain flashcard?
Physical cards are bulky and hard to search for. They are also very difficult to organise. Flashy is the result of our desire to eliminate these challenges that arise from the use of conventional flashcards. Flashy helps you organise your flashcards using its *tagging* system. By associating flashcards to different tags, Flashy is able to retrieve all flashcards of a given tag in a flash.

Studies have shown that *spaced repetition* is far more effective than regular studying.
And thus we gave Flashy an intelligent scheduler to help space out your study sessions and make them more effective.
// comment: do we want to add Italisization for Flashy?
// comment: how do we reference special words like spaced repetition?

Although Flashy is best suited for language learners,
it is able to handle thousands of cards. Therefore, Flashy should prove useful for any student hoping to improve their flashcard organisation.

Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, there are three different kinds of flashcards: normal, MCQ and fill-in-the-blanks. +
Normal flashcards are simple question and answer cards with the question being at the front and answer at the back. +
Fill-in-the-blanks flashcards are similar to normal flashcards, just that the question has blanks to prompt the users, and the back of the card has answers to the blanks. +
MCQ flashcards allows you to provide different options as the answer, similar to an MCQ question, and the back will have the number for which option is the correct one.

In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter down the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.

Cards can have multiple tags.

=== Managing Cards

// tag::selectcard[]
==== Selecting a flashcard : `selectc`

You can select a card that is currently being listed with the `selectc` command. +
Format: `selectc INDEX`

<<fig:cardIndex>> shows where the index of a card can be found at:

[[fig:cardIndex]]
.Diagram indicating location of the displayed index
image::cardIndex.png[width="350"]

Examples:

* `selectc 2` +
Selects the 2nd card in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st card in the list.

// end::selectcard[]

// tag::addcard[]
==== Adding a flashcard: `addc`

Adds a flashcard to Flashy. The presence of `o/OPTION` parameters will determine whether it is a normal or MCQ-type flashcard. +
Format: `addc f/FRONT b/BACK t/TAG` or +
`addc f/FRONT o/OPTION o/OPTION .. b/BACK t/TAG`

[CAUTION]
Ensure that the parameter for `b/` falls between 1 the number of options inclusive.
[CAUTION]
Ensure that if there are blanks, the parameter for `b/` should have the same number of answers (separated by `,`) as there are blanks.

Examples:

* `addc f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy t/Trivia` +
Adds a normal flashcard with the front and back of the first card being `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, as well as tagging it as `Trivia`.
* `addc f/A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles. b/equal, right` +
Adds a fill-blanks card with the front and back of the card being `A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles.` and `equal, right` respectively. +
Note that a blank is denoted by a single underscore `_`. +
* `addc f/Which continent is Singapore in? o/Asia o/Africa o/Australia o/South America b/1` +
Adds a MCQ-type flashcard with the front being `Which continent is Singapore in?`, options includes `Asia`, `Africa`, `Australia` and `South America` and back being `1`.

[TIP]
A flashcard can have any number of tags (including 0). +
// end::addcard[]

// tag::editcard[]
==== Editing a flashcard : `editc`

Edits an existing flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editc INDEX [f/FRONT] [o/OPTION] .. [b/BACK] [+t/TAG] [-t/TAG]`

****
* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
* A particular type of flashcard (normal, MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks) can only be edited to the same type of flashcard (e.g. you cannot edit a normal flashcard to a MCQ flashcard).
* When removing a tag from a flashcard, ensure that the tag exists and the flashcard is associated with that tag.
****

Examples:

* `editc 1 f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy +t/Trivia` +
Edits the front and back of the 1st flashcard to be `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, and also add a Trivia tag to it.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong -t/Trivia` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`, and remove its tag Trivia.
* `editc 1 o/Asia o/Australia o/Africa` +
Edits the options of the 1st flashcard to be `Asia`, `Australia` and `Africa`. (Only if that flashcard is a MCQ flashcard).

[CAUTION]
Ensure that the constraints on flashcard is not violated when editing. For constraints, refer to the *Caution* warning under Section 4.1.1: Adding a flashcard.
// end::editcard[]

// tag::deletecard[]
==== Deleting a flashcard : `deletec`

Deletes the specified flashcard. +

[NOTE]
If a tag no longer has associated flashcards, the tag will also be removed. Don't be alarmed if some of your tags are also removed in the process!

Format: `deletec INDEX`

****
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

`deletec 2` +
Deletes the 2nd flashcard in the list.
// end::deletecard[]

=== Managing Tags
==== Selecting a tag : `select`

Selects the tag identified by the index number. This will show only flashcards with the tag selected. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `select 2` +
Selects the 2nd tag in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st tag in the list.

==== Filtering tags: `find`

Filters the tag list to contain those that match the search terms. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====
The search is case-insensitive, but finds exact partial matches to the tag name.
====

Examples:

* `find biology` will show only tags matching the word `biology`. This will match `Biology`, `biology`, `biOlogy`,
and `Biology Midterms`, but not `bio`, or `chemistry`.

==== Clearing filters: `list`

The usage of `list` is 2-fold. `list` allows you to see all your flashcards and tags by clearing all filters. `list`
can also be invoked with an additional flag as `list -t`, to list all cards without tags. This allows you to reorganize
otherwise cards that are otherwise inaccessible. +

Format: `list [-t]`

Examples:

* `list` +
Shows all tags and cards.
* `list -t` +
Shows all tags, but shows only cards without tags.

==== Editing a tag : `edit`

Updates an existing tag to the specified values. +
Format: `edit INDEX n/TAG c/COLOR`

****
* Edits the tag at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the current tag listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Color must be a string of length 6 specifying a link:https://htmlcolorcodes.com/[hex color code]. For example, the color white is represented as `FFFFFF`.
* The existing name of the tag will be replaced with the value that was entered.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 n/French` +
Changes the name of the first tag in the list to `French`.

==== Deleting a Tag: `delete`

Deletes an existing tag. This will remove the tag from all cards that have the tag.

Examples:

* `delete 1` deletes the first visible tag.
* `delete 2` deletes the second visible tag.

=== Using flashcards
After adding and managing your flashcards, its time to get your A+!
This section will teach you how to let Flashy's intelligent scheduling algorithm prompt you the best time to study!

==== Showing a flashcard : `showdue`
To start using a flashcard, you have to click on a flashcard first.
`showdue` helps you filter out cards that are due by a certain date.
Using it without any arguments will show cards due by today.

Format: `showdue d/DAY m/MONTH y/YEAR`

[NOTE]
`showdue` can be used without any options, this will just show the flashcards due by today. +
You can omit some parameters in `showdue`. suppose to day is `13/04/2018`,
paramters that you omit would be implicitly assumed to be the current day, month or year.
If you key in `showdue d/28` without typing in `m/04 y/2018`,
the month and year are assumed to be the current month. +
This would show you card due before `28/04/2018`.

Examples:

* `showdue d/28 m/04 y/2018` +
Show cards due before 28/04/2018
* `showdue d/28` +
Suppose today is 13/04/2018, although `m/04 y/2018` is not typed,
they are implicitly assumed to be the current month and year.

==== Answering flashcards: `answer`
After using `showdue` to show a list of flashcards, you have to click on it to use the flashcard.
`answer` uses our spaced repetition algorithm to intelligently schedule the card to the right time in the future for review.

Format: `answer c/CONFIDENCE_LEVEL`

[IMPORTANT]
CONFIDENCE_LEVEL can only be 0, 1 or 2. +
Card must be selected first before answering.
// wait for select card to appear then I link here to there wit ha note.

===== What does `CONFIDENCE_LEVEL` mean?

* `answer c/0` Again +
I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer c/1` Passable +
I kind of know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer c/2` Easy A+ +
Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.

[TIP]
====
This gives feedback to the scheduler algorithm to automatically schedule the card for review at a time when it thinks you are likely to forget it.

This design is based off the well known forgetting curve, you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve
====

==== Show flashcards for review: `Schedule`
Using the `answer` command to answer a flash card will automatically schedule the card based on our spaced repetition algorithm.
However sometimes when you need to manually `schedule` a card for review you can do so as well.

Format: `schedule  d/DAY m/MONTH y/YEAR`

[NOTE]
`schedule` can be used without any options, this will just schedule the cards for today. +
You can omit some parameters in `schedule`. suppose to day is `13/04/2018`,
paramters that you omit would be implicitly assumed to be the current day, month or year.
If you key in `schedule d/28` without typing in `m/04 y/2018`,
the month and year are assumed to be the current month. +
This would schedule the card for `28/04/2018`.

Examples:

* `schedule d/28 m/04 y/2018` +
Schedule card for 28/04/2018
* `schedule d/28` +
Suppose today is 13/04/2018, although `m/04 y/2018` is not typed,
they are implicitly assumed to be the current month and year.

// tag::qualityoflife[]
=== Quality-of-Life features

Flashy has many features to speed up your workflow and make your experience as pain-free as possible.

==== Autocompletion

Instead of memorising the parameters of all the commands, you can instruct Flashy to automatically fill in the relevant parameters for you! After typing a valid command, simply press `TAB` and let Flashy handle the rest.

==== Clearing all data : `clear`

Rather than manually deleting cards and tags, Flashy is able to clear all of its data for you. +
Format: `clear`

[TIP]
This command will instruct Flashy to delete all tags and flashcards. Use this command with caution!

==== Listing entered commands : `history`

If you lose track of the actions you have made at any point in time, you can ask Flashy to list them for you in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
You can also press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows to display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====


==== Undo and Redo
Flashy does not come built in with an eraser. To compensate for that, some commands support undoing and redoing. The commands are `add`, `addc`, `addm`, `edit`, `editc`, `editm`, `delete`, `deletec`, and `clear`.


===== Undoing previous command : `undo`

You can restore the state of Flashy's card bank to its preious state before an _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

===== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Flashy can also revert any `undo` commands made by mistake! +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +

==== Exiting the program : `exit` or `quit`

Once you are confident in acing that exam, don't forget to power down Flashy! When this is done, Flashy will save all changes made to its card bank before gracefully shutting down. +
Format: `exit` or `quit`

// end::qualityoflife[]

=== Managing User Preferences

// tag::changetheme[]
==== Changing the theme : `theme`
Flashy knows that not all study sessions occur during the day. When carrying out all-nighters, remember that you can always switch the theme of Flashy's interface to match the lighting condition of your surroundings! +
Format: `theme t/THEME`

[TIP]
Flashy remembers your most recently used theme and will load it the next time you come back.

Examples:

* `theme t/light`
* `theme t/dark`

// end::changetheme[]
=== Saving the data

All data saved in Flashy's card bank is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.
