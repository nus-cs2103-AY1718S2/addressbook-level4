== PROJECT: STUtor - V1.5

---

== Overview

STUtor -V1.5 is a *desktop app* tailored for *tuition coordinators* to easily _match_ and _manage_ a database of tutors and students. +
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
added *the ability to review a person*
** What it does:
allows the user to _write a remark_ or _give a rating_ to a tutor/student based on their performance.
** Justification:
This feature allows the tuition coordinator to keep track on the performance of tutors and students.
This helps future matching as tutors/students strengths and weaknesses can be taken into consideration.
Rating allows the tuition coordinator to take note of the better performing and underperforming tutors/students.
** Highlights:
`Remark` and `Rate` require vastly different handling of inputs: `Remark` accepting any format (including null) while `Rate`
requires a fixed format between 0.0 to 5.0 (decimal can be omitted). For editing a remark, as it requires interaction with
`CommandBox` from UI, observer pattern is used to reduce coupling.


* *Minor enhancement*:
Added the ability to autofill commands using `Tab` key and delete prefixes using `Delete` key.
This facilitates the user when typing in commands, especially for long commands such as `add` and `edit`.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/functional/sherlynng.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/sherlynng.md[Test code]]
