== Feature Contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Customized alias
** What it does: Allows students to create their own aliases for all the commands and delete/unalias their created aliases if they do not want them anymore.
** Justification: This feature makes the use of CLI much more convenient as students can now type faster and in their own style. It improves the overall user experience from using the application as it makes it more personalized and user-friendly.

* *Minor enhancement*: Vacant Room Finder logic, parser and UI
** What it does: Shows the vacant rooms in the building that the student is searching for for the day.
** Justification: This allows students to easily find empty rooms for them to study in with their friends. Since students can have many pockets of free time in school, this feature displays the schedule of the rooms for the whole day so that students to plan their study venue.

* *Minor enhancement*: Google Maps location and direction navigator
** What it does: Finds the location of the specified address or the directions from place to place. This navigator recognises NUS building names and finds their respective locations, which makes it convenient for students to search for NUS venues.
** Justification: This allows students to find their way in NUS easily by searching for the buildings' common names rather than their postal codes or addresses.
