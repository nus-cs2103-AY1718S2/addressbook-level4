== Overview

My Team Manager (MTM) is a team managing application for football coaches. MTM is designed to be quick and easy for you to manage a team of players without the need of a mouse.

This developer's guide provides information that will not only show the design principles of the project, but allow you to understand the different implementations, and give you the opportunity to get started with being a contributor or as a reference for experienced developer.

This developer's guide consist of the following sections:

* <<Setting up, Setting up>>
* <<Design, Design>>
* <<Implementation, Implementation>>
* <<Documentation, Documentation>>
* <<Testing, Testing>>
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>>

== Setting up

The following pointers teach you how to get started with developing on our application. You’ll learn how to prepare yourself with the project on IntelliJ and run it. Then, you’ll update configurations in IntelliJ to easily match the coding standards and you’ll be ready to start coding.

But before you start, there are two fundamental prerequisites you should know about MTM:

=== Prerequisites

MTM is written in Java 8 and with the use of an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ, it provides you as a developer with a better environment suited for developing MTM to maintain coding standards and provide continuous integration.

. You are required to have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later,
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can download Java 8 from link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151[here].
+

. and *IntelliJ* IDE.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them. +
You can download IntelliJ from link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here].


=== Setting up the project on your computer

Before you begin setting up the project, please ensure that you’ve done the following on our GitHub repository (repo).

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

Upon completion of forking from our GitHub repo, you can proceed to set up your project on IntelliJ.

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message which will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Now that you’ve properly setup your project, you can verify that you have done everything properly.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

You have verified the setup and you’re all ready to dive into the code, but before you do, check out the following configurations that will help you make your coding more integrated and accurate.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

=== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Dive right in and get started with programming.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PlayerDetails` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Pre-existing

==== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::logging[]
==== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
// end::logging[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo/Redo feature
===== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`.
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`.
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


====== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo.
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Additional Functions Enhancements

// tag::remark[]
==== Remark Mechanism
===== Current Implementation
The remark mechanism is facilitated by `RemarkCommand`. The mechanism allows user to perform the adding, editing, and deleting of a single remark to a specified `Person` via the `INDEX` from the list shown in the `UI`. The field `remark` is similar to the other fields of `Person`, hence some of its logic in `AddCommand.java` and `EditCommand.java` are updated.

The mechanism uses the command `remark` and a `r/` prefix to add, edit, and delete a single remark of a `Person`. When the user leaves the remark as empty after the `r/` prefix, it is an indication to delete the remark, and when it is valid, it either create a new remark for that `Person` or overwrites the current existing remark.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the operation of the `remark` command:

//<insert sequence diagram>

_Figure : Sequence Diagram of `remark` Command_

The `remark` field is not required when adding or editing a `Person`, however it will be initialized to an empty string or retrieved to fit the implementation of the other fields.

Code snippet from `AddCommandParser.java` that shows that remark is initialized as empty.

[source, java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    // ... logic code ...

    try {

        // ... logic code ...

        Remark remark = new Remark("");

        Person person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, remark, tagList);

        return new AddCommand(person);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }

    // ... logic code ...
}
----

Code snippet from `EditCommand.java` that shows that remark is being retrieved.

[source, java]
----
private static Person createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit,
    EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {

    // ... logic code ...

    Remark updatedRemark = personToEdit.getRemark();

    return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail,
        updatedAddress, updatedRemark, updatedTags);
}
----

[TIP]
====
The field `remark` is found in `Person`, however it cannot be modified via `add` or `edit` commands. +
All functions related to `remark` is done strictly via the `remark` command.
====

[TIP]
====
Only one `remark` is saved at a time. If the user `remark` on the same person, it will be overwritten.
====

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `Remark` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates an additional `remark` field in `Person`.
** Pros: Follows the existing style of similar fields, making implementation easier.
** Cons: Could only have 1 remark per person, unless `remark` mechanism follows the `tag` mechanism to have multiple remarks.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a list of remarks that associates with the specified `Person`.
** Pros: Can have multiple remarks associating with a specific `Person`.
** Cons: Harder to maintain, more complicated.
// end::remark[]

// tag::privatefield[]
==== Setting various player fields to private `[coming in v1.5]`
===== Current Implementation

There is currently no implementation for this feature. Coming soon!

===== Design Consideration
// end::privatefield[]

// tag:sorting[]
==== Sorting players by fields
===== Current Implementation

The `sort` command is currently able to sort players by name, phone, email or address, in either ascending or descending order. Support for more fields will be added in subsequent updates.

* The `sort` command is parsed through `SortCommandParser` which hands control to the `SortCommand` class.

* Java Collections Sort API is used together with a custom `Comparator` in this implementation

Sorting is facilitated by the `SortCommand` which uses method `sortPlayers` to ultimately call method `sortBy` in UniquePersonList for the actual sorting as shown in this code snippet:
[source, java]
----
        switch (field) {
        case "name":
            comparator = nameComparator;
            break;

        case "phone":
            comparator = phoneComparator;
            break;

        case "email":
            comparator = emailComparator;
            break;

        case "address":
            comparator = addressComparator;
            break;

        default:
            throw new AssertionError("Invalid field parameter entered...\n");
        }

        switch (order) {
        case "asc":
            Collections.sort(internalList, comparator);
            break;

        case "desc":
            Collections.sort(internalList, Collections.reverseOrder(comparator));
            break;

        default:
            throw new AssertionError("Invalid field parameter entered...\n");
        }
    }
----

The code above utilises a custom `Comparator` defined in the code below:
[source, java]
----
Comparator<Person> nameComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                return p1.getName().fullName.compareTo(p2.getName().fullName);
            }
        };

        Comparator<Person> phoneComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                return p1.getPhone().value.compareTo(p2.getPhone().value);
            }
        };

        Comparator<Person> emailComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                return p1.getEmail().value.compareTo(p2.getEmail().value);
            }
        };

        Comparator<Person> addressComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                return p1.getAddress().value.compareTo(p2.getAddress().value);
            }
        };
----

The following sequence diagram shows the program flow when `sort` is used: <image>

[NOTE]
If address book is empty, a `NoPlayerException` will be thrown by `sortBy` method in UniquePlayerList.

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: Implementation of `sort`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorting is done in `UniquePersonList`.
** Pros: Sorting methods resides in class that handles most operations done to list. Future changes to implementation would be easier.
** Cons: Complicated flow of control passed between classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Sorting is done in `SortCommand`.
** Pros: Easier to trace flow of control as lesser passing between classes.
** Cons: Unnecessary coupling if `UniquePersonList` has to rely on `SortCommand`.

====== Aspect: Sort by multiple fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort can only be done by 1 field.
** Pros: Easy to implement and input is straightforward.
** Cons: Unable to fine tune to great detail how teams are sorted and displayed.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort can be done by multiple fields.
** Pros:  Able to fine tune to great detail how teams are sorted and displayed.
** Cons: Unnecessary as team managers would not need to sort players by multiple fields.

====== Aspect: Sort Persistence

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Address book is saved after sorting.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Allows team managers to use preferred sort pattern in every session.
** Cons: Previous order of players will be lost.
* **Alternative 2:** Address book is not saved after sorting.
** Pros: Good if team manager wants to sort players for current session only.
** Cons: Sort order is lost when program exits. More memory is used to sort a list and reverse it after.
// end::sorting[]

// tag::team[]
==== Team Mechanism
===== Current Implementation

The team mechanism is created to provide better organizational methods to the user for organizing their players. We achieved it by introducing a `UniqueTeamList` into the application which consists of a list of `Team` objects.

`Team` objects consist of `TeamName` object, which is used to uniquely identify the team, and `UniquePersonList` object which stores the information of `Person` objects which should be identical to those found in `UniquePersonList` in `addressbook`.

Code snippet from `Team.java` that shows the attributes of `Team`.

[source, java]
----
public class Team {

    private final TeamName teamName;
    private final UniquePersonList players = new UniquePersonList();

    // ... model method ...
}
----

Since `Person` stored in `Team` is referencing to the `Person` in `addressbook`, changes made to `Person` needs to be ensured that is properly propagated to the `Person` objects found in `Team`. An additional `TeamName` field is also added to `Person` so that the user can quickly determine the team the player is in.

Code snippet from `<somefile>.java` that shows the propagation of details updated in `Person` from `addressbook` to the `Person` objects in `Team`.

Currently, with the `Team` mechanism, additional commands such as `create`, `remove`, and `editteam` gives the user basic functionality for team management. Additionally, commands like `assign`, `view`, `setmatch`, and `viewmatch` gives the user more practical uses in managing multiple teams.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the operation of the `Team` mechanism and some of its respective commands:

_Figure : Sequence Diagram of `Team` mechanism_

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `Team`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Team` object stores the reference to `Person` objects that is also in `UniquePersonList` and `TeamName` is also an attribute of `Person`.
** Pros: Provides an easier lookup of person belonging in which team without the need of iterating through the `UniqueTeamList` for a specific `Person`, and efficient way of listing all `Persons` in a `Team`.
** Cons: Checks need to be done thoroughly to ensure that code does not break when changes are made, especially the synchronisation of `Person` details in `Team` and in `addressbook`.
* **Alternative 2:** `Team` object is stored in `Person` object as an attribute.
** Pros: Logical thought process to include `Team` as an attribute.
** Cons: Excess storage wasted due to duplicated data of `Team` in every `Person`.
// end::team[]

// tag::showbestxi[]
==== Show Best XI `[coming in v1.5]`
===== Current Implementation

The `showBest` command is able to show the current team's best 11 players. There is however functional implementation for this feature yet. Coming soon!

===== Design Consideration
// end::showbestxi[]

=== Usability Enhancements

// tag::autocomplete[]
==== Tab Autocomplete
===== Current Implementation

The tab autocomplete feature works by handling the Tab key pressed event, searching for any commands with matching prefix and returns one if found.
The command strings are stored in a Trie data structure, named `CommandTrie`, for optimal search.

[source, java]
----
public class CommandTrie {
    String attemptAutoComplete (String input);
    void insert (String input);
    Set<String> getCommandSet();
}
----

The trie is made up of `TrieNode` objects which contains three objects. The `TrieNode sibling` represents a character on the same level as the current one. The `TrieNode child` represents a next possible letter.
For example in the words `edit` and `exit`, the node for `d` would have a child `i` and a sibling `x`. `x` would have a child `i`.

[source, java]
----
public class TrieNode {

    private TrieNode sibling;
    private TrieNode child;
    private char key;
    ...
}

----
Upon the pressing of the tab key, the command box calls `attemptAutoComplete`, in the `commandTrie` class. With the content of the command box as the query, attemptAutoComplete searches for the query using the standard Trie search algortihm.
If the query prefix itself is not present in the trie, then the attempt fails. If the query reaches a `TrieNode` with a `sibling` or `child` `TrieNode`,
it will provide the user with possible commands for a given input. In this case, a dropdown box will appear in the UI that lists the possible commands for the user.

Upon finding a matching command, `attemptAutoComplete` returns it and replaces the text in the Command Line. If the no matching command is found, the text is turned red.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::enhancedadd[]
==== Optional Fields for Add Mechanism
===== Current Implementation
This mechanism enhances the original implementation of the `add` command. The required fields that are mandatory to be filled by the user are `n/NAME` and `e/EMAIL`. This implementation of making fields optional for `AddCommand` allows user to add players without their full information, and can be updated accordingly when the user retrieves their full information.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the operation of the enhancement made to `add` command:

//<insert sequence diagram>

_Figure : Sequence Diagram of Enhanced `add` Command_

Code snippet from `ParserUtil.java` that shows the implementation of when a field is left empty. "<UNSPECIFED>" string will be return when the value passed in is empty.

[source, java]
----
public class ParserUtil {

    // ... model code ...

    public static final String UNSPECIFIED_FIELD = "<UNSPECIFIED>";

    // ... model code ...

    public static Optional<String> parseValue(Optional<String> value) {
        return Optional.of(value.orElse(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD));
    }

    // ... model code ...
}
----

Code snippet from `AddCommandParser.java` that shows the usage of parsing fields that are set as optional.

[source,java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    // ... logic code ...

    if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_EMAIL)
        || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }

    try {

    // ... logic code ...

        Phone phone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(
            ParserUtil.parseValue(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE)).get());
        Address address = ParserUtil.parseAddress(
            ParserUtil.parseValue(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS)).get());

        // ... logic code ...

        Person person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, tagList);

        return new AddCommand(person);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }

    // ... logic code ...
}
----

Code snippet from `Address.java` that shows an example of an optional field being valid when not specified.

[source, java]
----
public class Address {

    // ... model code ...

    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX) || test.equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD);
    }
}
----

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: Implementation of Optional fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set a default value for unspecified fields and parse fields that are mandatory.
** Pros: Easy to implement as fields are still filled with information even though user did not specify.
** Cons: Unattractive display of fields when it is unspecified.
* **Alternative 2:** Require users to input all fields.
** Pros: The current implementation is used, hence there is no additional code to ensure validity of unspecified input.
** Cons: Less flexibility is given to the user when adding a player into the application.
// end::enhancedadd[]

// tag::settagcolour[]
==== Set Tag Colour feature
===== Current Implementation

* The `Set` Command is an entirely new command that will allow the user to assign a colour to a specific tag.
* This mechanism is facilitated by the `SetCommandParser`, which creates and returns a new `SetCommand`.
* The following diagrams show the inheritance for the commands: <image>
* In `SetCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface, it parses the arguments inputted into the CLI, and checks whether the arguments are valid.

`SetCommandParser` is implemented as such:

[source, java]
----
public class SetCommandParser implements Parser<SetCommand> {

    public SetCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    // ...parse arguments and check for invalid arguments...
  }
}
----

* `SetCommand` inherits the abstract `Command` class. After `execute()` is called in `SetCommand`, the tag colour is set through the logic portions of `ModelManager` and `AddressBook`, then
lastly changes `tagColour` attribute within the `Tag` object itself. +

`SetCommand` is implemented in this way:

[source, java]
----
public class SetCommand extends Command {

    private final Tag tagToSet;
    private final String tagColour;

    public SetCommand(Tag tag, String colour) {
        requireNonNull(tag);
        tagToSet = tag;
        tagColour = colour;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
    // ...set colour logic...
    }

}
----

* The following sequence diagram shows how the set command operation works:
<image>

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Inherit from `Command`.
** Pros: Does not involve complicated undo/redo tests, simple and quicker implementation,
lessen chances of mistakes made in implementation.
** Cons: User cannot use the `undo/redo` command.
* **Alternative 2 :** Inherit from `UndoableCommand`.
** Pros: User can utilise the `undo/redo` command.
** Cons: Hard for developers to implement extra tests, not very necessary as users can just as easily type
out the colour they would like to change their tag to; it is a short command, especially with the `stc` alias.
// end::settagcolour[]

=== UI Enhancements

// tag::teamDisplay[]
==== Team Display Bar
===== Current Implementation

* The Team Display Bar is implemented as `TeamDisplay` in the UI Component and renders `TeamDisplay.fxml`.
* It is called from `MainWindow` and will be highlighting
the current team that has been selected in the Command Line Interface by the user.
* It calls the `Team` model and displays the `Person` cards associated with that `Team`.
* It contains event handler methods such as handleShowNewTeamEvent(), handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent(),
and handleDeselectTeamEvent().

Code snippet from 'TeamDisplay' to show initialisation of UI component and event handlers:

[source, java]
----
public class TeamDisplay extends UiPart<Region> {

    private static final String FXML = "TeamDisplay.fxml";

    public TeamDisplay() {
        super(FXML);
            this.teamList = teamList;
            initTeams();
            getTeams();
            registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleShowNewTeamEvent(ShowNewTeamNameEvent event) {
        ...handleShowNewTeamEvent code...
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent(HighlightSelectedTeamEvent event) {
        ...handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent code...
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleDeselectTeamEvent(DeselectTeamEvent event) {
        ...handleDeselectTeamEvent code...
    }
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TeamDisplay` is placed underneath the `ResultDisplay` and above the `PersonListPanel`.
** Pros: Located at an obvious location for the user to view the team currently selected.
** Cons: There will be less space for the `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox`.
* **Alternative 2:** `TeamDisplay` is placed on the left of the `PersonListPanel` as a vertical bar.
** Pros: There will be more space for the `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox`.
** Cons: It is less obvious to the user as it is at the side.
// end::teamDisplay[]

// tag::PlayerDetails[]
==== Player Details Pane
===== Current Implementation

* The `Player Details` pane is implemented as `PlayerDetails` in the UI Component. It is called from `PlayerListPanel`.
* It renders `PlayerDetails.fxml` and displays the selected `PersonCard`.
* It calls the `Person` model and displays the fields in the `Person` model that are not displayed in the left panel.

Code snippet from 'PlayerDetails' to show initialisation of UI component:

[source, java]
----
public class PlayerDetails extends UiPart<Region> {

    private static final String FXML = "PlayerDetails.fxml";
    public final Person person;

    public PlayerDetails(Person person) {
        super(FXML);
        this.person = person;
        //....player details code...
    }

}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `PlayerDetails` is placed on the right of `Person List Panel`, replacing the `BrowserPanel`.
** Pros: It is the only large unused space in the software left and is right beside the `Person List Panel`, thus is the logical
place to look at after selection of a person card.
** Cons: This is a lot of whitespace in the pane as are not many fields.
* **Alternative 2:** `PlayerDetails` pane size is reduced and the extra space is repurposed.
** Pros: There will be more space for another new feature e.g. calendar.
** Cons: It can only be implemented in v2.0 due to time constraints in development.
// end::playerDetails[]

==== Change Theme Command `[coming in v1.5]`
===== Current Implementation

* The `ChangThemeCommand` is a new feature that allows user to change the current theme to another theme.
* New css classes are implemented to accommodate the new themes.
* The `MainWindow` class is also changed to allow for switch cases depending on which theme is selected. +
Code snippet from 'ChangThemeCommand':

[source, java]
----
//code snippet
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ChangeThemeCommand` is implemented as a CLI command.
** Pros: Consistent with the rest of the application, of which all changes are made by the CLI.
** Cons: User has yet another command to remember the syntax of.
* **Alternative 2:** Change of theme is implemented as a button to change onClick.
** Pros: User does not have to type anything to change the theme, so it might be more user friendly.
** Cons: Inconsistent with the rest of the application, which is CLI-based.
// end::changeThemeCommand[]

== Documentation

We use https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoc] for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

// [[GetStartedProgramming]]
// [appendix]
// == Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started
//
// Suggested path for new programmers:
//
// 1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.
//
// 2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.
//
// [[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
// === Improving each component
//
// Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).
//
// [discrete]
// ==== `Logic` component
//
// *Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.
//
// [TIP]
// Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.
//
// . Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
// +
// ****
// * Hints
// ** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
// ** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
// * Solution
// ** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
// ** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
// ** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
// ** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
// ****
//
// [discrete]
// ==== `Model` component
//
// *Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.
//
// [TIP]
// Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
//
// . Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
// +
// ****
// * Hints
// ** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
// ** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
// **  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
// * Solution
// ** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
// ** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
// ** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
// ** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
// *** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
// *** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
// ****
//
// [discrete]
// ==== `Ui` component
//
// *Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.
//
// [TIP]
// Do take a look at <<Design-`Ui`>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.
//
// . Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

// +
// ****
// * Hints
// ** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
// ** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
// ** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
// * Solution
// ** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
// ** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
// *** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
// ****
//
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

// ** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
// * Solution
// ** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
// ** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
// ** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
// *** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
// *** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

// ** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
// ** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
// * Solution
// ** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
// ** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
// ** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
// ** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

// ==== `Storage` component
//
// *Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.
//
// [TIP]
// Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.
//
// . Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
// +
// ****
// * Hint
// ** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
// ** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

// [[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
// === Creating a new command: `remark`
//
// By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.
//
// *Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.
//
// ==== Description
// Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
// Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`
//
// Examples:
//
// * `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
// Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
// * `remark 1 r/` +
// Removes the remark for the first person.
//
// ==== Step-by-step Instructions
//
// ===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
// Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
// . Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.
//
// ===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
// Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
// . Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
// . Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
// for `RemarkCommandParser`.
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.
//
// ===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
// Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
// . Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.
//
// ===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
// We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
// . Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.
//
// ===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
// Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
// . You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)
//
// ===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
// We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.
//
// ===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
// Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
// . Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].
//
// ===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
// Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.
//
// ===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
// We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.
//
// **Main:**
//
// . Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.
//
// **Tests:**
//
// . Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
//
// ==== Full Solution
//
// See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.
