* This is a desktop TuitionCor application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* TuitionCor is targeted at tuition coordinators who have to manage a large amount of contacts.
* The daily job-scope of a tuition coordinator involves the need to manage large amount of contacts and match the students to tutors according to their credentials, needs and location.
* Therefore, TuitionCor aims to facilitate this process and make the job of a tuition coordinator easier.
* In addition, users are also able to
** Add clients
** Match students to tutors or vice versa
** Sort clients based on a particular aspect
** Find clients based on keywords
** Close assigned clients
** Restore closed clients
