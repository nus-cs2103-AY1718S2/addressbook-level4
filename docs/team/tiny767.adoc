== PROJECT: Infinity Book

== Overview

Infinity Book (IB) is an address book application for Tech recruiters, providing end-to-end support, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of Facebook integration.
*** Description: Facebook integration allows tech recruiters to integrate their facebook accounts to InfinityBook so that they conveniently use Facebook features on InfinityBook itself.

*** Justification: Infinity Book is an end-to-end application designed for tech recruiters. We understand that many tech recruiters use social network platform to screen their candidates. With this in mind, we want to improve their productivity by integrating facebook into Infinity itself. Recruiters no longer need to switch between different applications. Instead, they can mostly rely on InfinityBook alone.

*** Highlights: This enhancement touches multiple components:

**** Added a new panel to UI component to handle authorisation and to act as a GUI for facebook page.

**** Modified Logic component to accept new commands.

**** Register InfinityBook as an application under Facebook for Developer page to make use of Facebook Graph API

**** Made use of RestFB API as a Facebook Graph client API to communicate with Facebook

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a command to change theme.
*** Description: Previously, InfinityBook has a single dark theme that might not be very appealing to tech recruiters. This feature allows recruiters to switch between different pre-defined theme.
*** Justification: This feature is much needed to improve the look of the app. Moreover, we can continue working on building better-looking themes to release in future iterations.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a 'remark' field to person.
*** Description: Added a flexible 'remark' field and the command to edit it.
*** Justification: Tech recruiters might have additional information for their contacts and relying on tags alone is not enough.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W11-B3/main/blob/master/collated/functional/anh2111.md[Functional code]][https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W11-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/anh2111.md[Test code]]
