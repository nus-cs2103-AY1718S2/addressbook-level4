== Introduction

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their tasks and events.
CLIndar is *Common-Line Interface (CLI) based and uses Linux-style commands*, which computing students are familiar with.
Thus, compared to traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications, CLIndar is faster and provides much convenience for computing students.

== Get Started

To start using CLIndar, follow the instructions below:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CLIndar.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
*Please insert an image here*
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`task`* `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 d/16/03/2018 17:00 r/Enhance major component`: Adds Software Engineering task to the board in CLIndar
* **`event`* `n/Software Project s/01/05/2018 8:00 e/01/08/2018 8:00 l/School of Computing`: Adds Software Project event to the board
* *`list task`* : list all uncompleted tasks
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

The following are the commands of CLIndar:

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `task n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `task n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1 r/urgent` or as `n/Software Engineering Milestone 1`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATETIME`, `d/DATETIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

`clear` +
`u` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`u` (reverses the `rm task 1` command) +
`r` (reapplies the `rm task 1` command) +
