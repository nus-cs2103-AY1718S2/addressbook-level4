* CLindar is a desktop application that intends to help university computing students to manage their tasks and events.
** Computing student may have a tight schedule hence required to keep track of various events and deadlines
** Computing student would be more familiar with the commands used in this application, hence would be easy to use.
* It is a GUI app but most of its user interaction is CLI (Command Line Interface)-based.
** This would allow fast input for users who can type fast, such as computing students.
* You would need to have *Java Runtime Environment* (JRE) installed to run this application.
