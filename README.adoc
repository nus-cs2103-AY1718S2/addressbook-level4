* Codeducator is a desktop address book application for private programming language tutors.
* As a programming language tutor, managing your student contacts and tracking their progress may be too much of a hassle. Codeducator helps alleviate your problems by providing features that make this tracking process more convenient, so that you can just focus on teaching your students.
* Codeducator has a GUI but the user input is done using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
