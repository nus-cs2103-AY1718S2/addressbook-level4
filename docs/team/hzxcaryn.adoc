== PROJECT: Part-time Manager (PTMan)

== Overview

PTMan is a desktop human resource application used for managing part-time employees. +

PTMan aims to give part-time employees the freedom of choosing when they want to work by registering for the available shifts set by the manager.
Thereby reducing the hassle of work scheduling for both employers and employees. +

The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added an interactive *timetable*.
** What it does:
*** Provides a sophisticated timetable which displays the shifts added by managers.
*** Instantly reflects any changes to shifts on the timetable. This includes the addition/deletion of a shift, and the application/removal of an employee to/from a shift.
*** Allows easy navigation across the different weeks through keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks.
*** Allows employees to view the shifts they are assigned to on the timetable.
*** Allows users to view which employees are working in any particular shift.
*** Supports the exporting of timetable as image to be saved as a file locally, or forwarded to users through our email service.
** Justification: This feature improves the user experience of PTMan significantly because a user can get helpful visual feedback whenever changes are made to the shifts in PTMan.
Convenience is also brought to employees through the ability to export their work timetable, allowing them to refer to it in the future without the need to access the app.
** Highlights:
This enhancement puts user experience in high regard.
Lots of consideration is put into making the feature easy to use and useful for users.
The implementation of this enhancement mainly required changes to Ui, Model, and Logic components.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Allocated different colors for different tags that are assigned to employees. This allows users to easily classify and identify the different tags.
** Modified the result display to display error messages in red. This allows users to quickly identify when they make a mistake.
