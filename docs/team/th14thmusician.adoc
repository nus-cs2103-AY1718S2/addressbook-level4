== PROJECT: Club Connect

---

== Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

*Code Contributed* : [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/th14thmusician.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/th14thmusician.md[Test code]]
