== PROJECT: CelebManager

---

== Overview

CelebManager is a software application that allows celebrity managers to maintain schedules of celebrities under them.
It is optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual feedback.

In this software, the users will be able to:

.   Manage contacts
.	Manage appointments
.	Manage calendars
.	Plan efficient routes

This project portfolio summarises my contribution towards the development of CelebManager.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *support for interacting with the calendar using CLI*
** What it does: This enhancement includes commands: `viewCalendar`, `viewCombinedCalendar`, `viewCalendarBy`, and
`viewDate`. With these commands, users can view different celebrities' calendars, a joint calendar of all celebrities,
a day's or week's or month's appointments, and change base date of the calendar.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to interact with the
calendar inside CeleManager and makes the calendar a powerful visualisation tool to view timings of appointments.
** Highlights: The implementation requires comprehension of CalendarFX's API and experimenting with the API to
understand which methods to be used to update the calendar UI. Also, additional variables were created
to keep track of the current calendar's status to preserve the original ways of interaction between different
components.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to delete an appointment*
** What it does: This enhancement refers to the command, `deleteAppointment`. It allows users to delete an existing
appointment.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users can delete a specified appointment to
get rid of appointments that are cancelled or no longer needed.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires an understanding of how appointments are stored and can be removed from the
calendar visually.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to list appointments within a given date range*

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to remove a tag from all contacts*

==== Displaying a celebrity's calendar: `viewCalendar` [Since v1.3]

Changes to view the calendar of the specified celebrity. +
Alias: `vc` +
Format: `viewCalendar INDEX`

****
* Changes to view the calendar of the celebrity at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the last shown list of persons.
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
* The person at `INDEX` *must be* a celebrity.
****

Examples:

* `viewCalendar 1` +
Changes to view the calendar of the 1st person in the last shown person list, if he/she is a celebrity.

==== Displaying a specific date's calendar: `viewDate` [Since v1.5]

Changes the base date of calendar and displays the calendar by day for the specified `date`.
The base date is different from the current date. It is a date which `viewCalendarBy` is based on. Refer to the tip
below examples for more information. +
Alias: `vd` +
Format: `viewDate [DATE]`

****
* Changes base date to the specified `date`.
* When no date is given, it takes on the value of current date.
* `DATE` *must be in the format of* `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`. For the latter, year will be set to current year.
* `DATE` *must be* a valid date, eg, `01-13-2018` and `30-02` are not valid dates.
* This command can take slightly longer to load than other view-related commands.
****

Examples:

* `viewDate 03-05-2018` +
Changes the base date of calendar to `03-05-2018` and displays the calendar by day for `03-05-2018` as shown below.

.State of `CalendarPanel` after executing `viewDate 03-05-2018`
image::ViewDate03-05-2018.jpg[width="500"]

* `viewDate` +
Changes the base date of calendar to current date and displays the calendar by day for current date. +

[TIP]
====
Change in base date allows you to view calendar for different weeks and months.
For example, after `viewDate 03-05-2018`, you can type `viewCalendarBy week` - which will show you the
calendar for the first week of May of 2018, or `viewCalendarBy month` - which will show you the calendar
for May of 2018.
====

====  Deleting an appointment `deleteAppointment` [Since v1.4]

Pre-requisite: you can only edit an appointment when `CalendarPanel` is showing an appointment list.
Refer to User Guide - Listing appointments: `listAppointment` [Since v1.5] for more information. +

Deletes the specified appointment. +
Alias: `da` +
Format: `deleteAppointment INDEX`

****
* Deletes the appointment at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the current appointment list.
* `INDEX` index *must be a positive integer* `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
* If there is no more appointment in the list after deletion, `CalendarPanel` will switch back from the appointment list
to the calendar.
****

Examples:

* `listAppointment` +
`deleteAppointment 2` +
Deletes the 2nd appointment in the appointment list.

* `listAppointment 01-04 01-05` +
`deleteAppointment 1` +
Deletes the 1st appointment in the result of `listAppointment 01-04 01-05`.

==== Removing a tag : `removeTag` [Since v1.2]

=== DeleteAppointment Feature

This feature allows the user to delete appointments.

==== Current Implementation

The mechanism to delete an appointment is facilitated by the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` class, which resides inside `Logic`,
and `deleteAppointment` method in `Model`. The command requires the user to put in an index to refer to the appointment
to be deleted. This index is taken from the currently displayed appointment list. As such, deletion of an appointment
can only be done when CelebManager is showing an appointment list.

`DeleteAppointmentCommand` class is responsible for checking whether an appointment list is currently being shown.
If so, `DeleteAppointmentCommand` class will call `deleteAppointment` method. Refer to the code snippet below to see
how this method deletes the specified appointment:

[source,java]
----
public class DeleteAppointmentCommand extends Command {
    ...
    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Deleted Appointment: %1$s";
    public static final String MESSAGE_APPOINTMENT_LIST_BECOMES_EMPTY = "\nAppointment list becomes empty, "
            + "Switching back to calendar view by day\n"
            + "Currently showing %1$s calendar";
    ...

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        // throw exception if the user is not currently viewing an appointment list
        if (!model.getIsListingAppointments()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_MUST_SHOW_LIST_OF_APPOINTMENTS);
        }
        apptToDelete = model.deleteAppointment(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        List<Appointment> currentAppointmentList = model.getAppointmentList();

        // if the list becomes empty, switch back to combined calendar day view
        if (currentAppointmentList.size() < 1) {
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeCalendarViewPageRequestEvent(DAY_VIEW_PAGE));
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowCalendarEvent());

            Celebrity currentCalendarOwner = model.getCurrentCelebCalendarOwner();
            if (currentCalendarOwner == null) {
                return new CommandResult(
                        String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, apptToDelete.getTitle())
                                + String.format(MESSAGE_APPOINTMENT_LIST_BECOMES_EMPTY,
                                "combined"));
            } else {
                return new CommandResult(
                        String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, apptToDelete.getTitle())
                                + String.format(MESSAGE_APPOINTMENT_LIST_BECOMES_EMPTY,
                                currentCalendarOwner.getName().toString() + "'s"));
            }
        }

        // if the list is not empty yet, update appointment list view
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowAppointmentListEvent(currentAppointmentList));

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, apptToDelete.getTitle()));
    }

    ...
}
----
From the snippet above, it can be seen that `DeleteAppointmentCommand` changes `CalendarPanel` back to combined
calendar view if there is no more appointment in the appointment list after deletion. Otherwise, the appointment list
with the specified appointment deleted will be shown.

The snippet code below shows the implementation of `deleteAppointment` in `Model`:

[source,java]
----
public class ModelManager extends ComponentManager implements Model {
    ...
    @Override
    public Appointment deleteAppointment(int index) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {
        Appointment apptToDelete = getChosenAppointment(index);
        apptToDelete.removeAppointment();
        removeAppointmentFromInternalList(index);
        currentlyDisplayedAppointments.remove(apptToDelete);
        indicateAppointmentListChanged();
        return apptToDelete;
    }
    ...
}
----

The method `removeAppointment` is in `Appointment` class, and removes all child entries of an appointment. For example,
an appointment may have two celebrities attending. Then this appointment will have two child entries, one each in each
attending celebrity's calendar. So when this appointment gets deleted, both entries should get removed as well.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Status of `CalendarPanel` after deletion of the only appointment
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Switch back to combined calendar view
** Pros: Keeps consistent with `listAppointment` as CelebManager does not show an empty list when there is no
appointment to list, but instead outputs an error message.
** Cons: Makes it difficult for users to see if the appointment gets deleted correctly.
* **Alternative 2:** Stay at the appointment list view and shows an empty list
** Pros: Shows the effect of deletion immediately.
** Cons: Becomes inconsistent with `listAppointment` command's inability to show an empty list when there is no
appointment to list.
* **Alternative 3:** Switch back to combined calendar view and goes to the day when the deleted appointment should
happen
** Pros: Keeps consistent with `listAppointment` while making it easy for users to check if the appointment gets
deleted visually on calendar.
** Cons: Takes long time to run.

===== Aspect: Ability to undo `deleteAppointment` command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Cannot be undone
** Pros: Needs not remember previous appointments' and calendar's status.
** Cons: Cannot restore deletions made by mistake.
* **Alternative 2:** Can be undone
** Pros: Can restore deletions made by mistake.
** Cons: Requires drastic change in the way calendars are currently saved and loaded, as calendars currently only stay
in UI component while appointments in Model component.
