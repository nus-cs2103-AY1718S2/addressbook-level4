== Overview

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their tasks and events. The user interacts with it using a CLI. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Makeover of the GUI and the ability to display different views of the GUI
** What it does: As the cells do not display full details of the activity, selecting it will allow the full details
of it being displayed in a separate panel which hides if no cell is selected. The user also can choose to
display task or events only, or both.
** Justification: This feature improves the application significantly because it reduces the clutter in the GUI,
making it more appealing and allows the user to switch between different views of the GUI depending on his needs.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of JavaFx. The implementation too was challenging as
building upon the application to include these enhancement required deep understanding of how the existing
application worked.
** Credits: CalendarFX - third-party library. Zoomable pane - //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16680295/javafx-correct-scaling

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced the existing help command. Allows the user to request for help for the command he specified.
