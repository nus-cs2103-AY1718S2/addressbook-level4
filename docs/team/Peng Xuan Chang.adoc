== PROJECT: Medeina

---

== Overview

Medeina is a desktop application designed to assist veterinarians and their assistants in managing contacts, pet patient details, and appointments.
The app utilises Command Line Interface (CLI), thus user will interact with the app using mostly commands.

Medeina is written in Java, and its graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Javafx.

This application was built upon an existing code base for an address book for the module CS2103T Software Engineering, and has around 20kLoC.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Integrating CalenderFX as framework for Calender view to show appointments, and and create new Panel to list petPatients
** What it does: allows the user to list out current PetPatients in the panel, and manage appointments using calendar view.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because user is now able to see Owners, PetPatients, and appointments on the same page.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands. It has greatly changed the original GUI.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added NRIC field in Ownerâ€™s profile
** What it does: The NRIC field will help the veterinarians and their assistants to better locate an owner using their unique ID.
** Justification: The feature helps user to avoid confusion when there are patients who share the same name. It also helps to tie pets to a certain user. When pets have duplicated names, they can be differentiated by their tagged NRICs.
