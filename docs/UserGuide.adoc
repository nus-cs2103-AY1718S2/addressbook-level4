== Quick Start
Follow the steps below to begin using _CoinBook_ :

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can obtain the latest version [ext]#http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]# (Download JRE).
+
.  Download the latest `coinbook.jar` [exref]#link:{repoURL}/releases[here]#.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your _CoinBook_.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds (Fig. 1).
+
.Startup Window
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. Type your commands in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute them. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

[TIP]
  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. Command <<alias,aliases>> are specified after the `|` symbol.

[[Features]]
== Features

_CoinBook_ allows you to manage your coin accounts easily through the use of commands. All you need to do is type in the command, followed by its required or optional _parameters_, then press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.

.Terminology
****
The following terms are used in the feature list to refer to specific concepts.
[[spec]]
* Target
** Refers to the account or group to execute the command upon
** This is used in commands requiring a target coin, and can be any one of the coin's:
*** `INDEX`: Its index number in the current coin listing
*** `CODE`: The trading code of the coin, e.g. `BTC`
*** `NAME`: The name of the coin, e.g. `Bitcoin`, and is case-insensitive [Coming in v2.0]
* Option/Parameter
** Refers to the additional information you must provide for the command
** These have a letter representing the option, followed by a slash (`/`), followed by the desired value
** The name of the option follows each letter. You should replace this with the desired value, e.g. `t/TAG` indicates the desired value of the tag should be typed after `t/`
****

.Command Format
****
Each command comes with a specific _format_ consisting of one or more parts. Please note the following conventions:

* Command parts denoted in `UPPERCASE` should be supplied by the user
* Parts in square brackets are optional, e.g.
`TARGET [t/TAG]`
can be used as either `BTC t/fav` or `BTC`
* Parts with `...` after them can be used zero or more times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cheap`, `t/active t/fav`, etc.
* If an option without `...` is used multiple times, only the rightmost value that you typed will be used, e.g. use of `c/CODE` as `c/BTC c/ETH` will be taken as `c/ETH` only
* Parameters can be in any order, e.g. if the command specifies `t/TAG a/VALUE`, then `a/VALUE t/TAG` is also acceptable
* Parts in curly braces indicate multiple possibilities, e.g. we use <<spec,`TARGET`>> as shorthand for `{INDEX,NAME,CODE}`

.Notification Options Format
****
* You can put `+` or `-` before specifying an amount to indicate a change in the property specified instead of its absolute value, for example:

** `p/pass:[-]>500`: Current price fell more than $500
****

.Examples
----
notify h/>0
----
Notify when the amount held in an account is more than 0 after the update. This always triggers and hence is useless on its own, but can be combined with other conditions to restrict notifications to a smaller set of accounts

// end::notifications[]

----
Notify when the amount worth in dollars of the `BTC` account is $50

----
notify w/+>1000 c/ETH

=== Change listing order `order` | `o` `[Coming in v1.5]`

.Format
----
order OPTION/{a,d}...
----

Orders the coin listing based on the specified details such as name, price, amount held, etc. Use the same letters in <<find,condition queries>>.

Put `a` after the option to sort it in ascending order, and `d` to sort in descending order. The listing is sorted by the leftmost entered option first, then equal values are sorted by the next one, and so on. The default order is alphabetical order of the coin names.

.Examples

 order p/a

Sort the listing in ascending order based on current prices

 order p/d n/d

Sort the listing in descending order based on the current prices first, then, if two coins have the same price, sort them by name in reverse alphabetical (i.e. descending) order

=== List past commands `history` | `h`

.Format
----
history
----

Lists all the commands that you have entered previously, in reverse chronological order.

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the UP and DOWN arrow keys will also display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo previous command `undo` | `z`

.Format
----
undo
----

Restores the data to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed.

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: Commands that modify the data (`buy`, `sell`, `tag` and `clear`)
====

.Examples
----
buy BTC a/10 <1>
list
undo <1>
----
This reverses the `buy BTC a/10` command.
----
view 1
list
undo
----
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.
----
sell BTC a/10 <2>
clear <1>
undo <1>
undo <2>
----
The first `undo` reverses the `clear` command, the second reverses the `sell BTC a/10` command.

=== Redo undone command `redo` | `y`

.Format
----
redo
----

Reverses the most recent `undo` command.

.Examples
----
buy BTC a/10 <1>
undo <1><2>
redo <2>
----
<1> Reverses the `buy BTC a/10` command, and
<2> Reapplies it

The result is as if only the first line was executed.

----
list
redo
----
The command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
----
sell BTC a/10 <2>
clear <1>
undo <1><4>
undo <2><3>
redo <3>
redo <4>
----
This sequence of commands:

<1> Reverses the `clear` command
<2> Reverses the `sell BTC a/10` command
<3> Reapplies the `sell BTC a/10` command, and finally
<4> Reapplies the `clear` command

The result is as if only the first two lines were executed. Notice how the order of redoing is opposite from the undoing.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Sync with price server `sync` | `u` `[Coming in v1.5]`

.Format
----
sync
----

Obtains the latest prices and refreshes the news feed from the Internet to update your coin data.

There is no need to save manually.

=== Autocomplete `[Coming in v1.5]`

Pressing kbd:[Tab] will autocomplete the field where the cursor is at with a matching suggestion.
Subsequent kbd:[Tab] key presses will cycle through the list of suggestions.
