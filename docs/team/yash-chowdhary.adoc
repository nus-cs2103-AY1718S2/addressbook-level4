== PROJECT: Club Connect

== 1. Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.


== 2. Purpose of Portfolio Page
This portfolio page describes the contribution I have made to Club Connect’s development – in terms of code, tests, and documentation. It comprises of extracts from the User Guide and Developer Guide, highlighting major and minor features that I worked on during the course of the semester. It also describes some of the other contributions I made – testing, PR reviews, and product management.

== 3. Summary of Contributions

*Major enhancement*: Task-Management +
*What it does*: allows users to add, assign, delete and modify tasks. +
*Justification* : Members of a club have certain responsibilities and must carry out tasks to fulfil their responsibilities. Furthermore, `EXCO` members can delegate tasks to other members which they must perform within a stipulated time period.
                  Maintaining a record of tasks is crucial as it help maintain transparency and accountability of the club.

*Minor enhancements*: +

* Added a `Group` attribute to `Member` as well as a command to remove a `Group` from the application. +
* Added an auto-complete feature which can be used by pressing the ```TAB``` key. +
* Added email functionality. +

== Appendix A : Proposed Enhancement

=== Data Encryption

==== External Behaviour
Implementing this feature will have no effect on the functionality that Club Connect provides to its users. The major change that this feature will bring is securing user data.
Users can rest assured that none of their data can be leaked to malicious foreign parties.

==== Justification
Data privacy is a controversial topic in today's world. When personal data falls into the wrong hands, it can be misused in ways we can’t possibly imagine. Every corporation, organization and service must provide data privacy not only because it's the law, but also to maintain consumer satisfaction.
