== PROJECT: Sell It

== Overview

Sell It is a desktop addressbook and calendar application built for salesmen. It is meant to keep track of a large number of clients based across many different countries as well as the appointments that are scheduled with them. It supports note-taking and archiving. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add and edit appointments* and to see them in a calendar
** What it does: allows the user to add an appointment. Existing appointments can be edited.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a salesperson may have many appointments with his clients that he wants to keep track of.
** Highlights: This enhancement's implementation is challenging as it involves many different modules of the code, such as the storage, model and logic modules.
** Credits: https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX] for the calendar feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: An archival feature for clients that the salesperson is no longer in contact with so that they do not clutter up the interface as the salesperson has to manage a lot of clients.

* *Minor enhancement*: A switch theme command to switch between dark and light themes.

* *Minor enhancement*: Command alias feature so that user does not have to type long commands.
