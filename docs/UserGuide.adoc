== Introduction

ContactSails is for salespersons who prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, orders, and events.

More importantly, it is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (link:#cli[CLI]), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]).

If you can type fast, ContactSails can get your sales management related tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== About This Guide

This User Guide will help you set up ContactSails on your desktop and explain the all the features provided by our application in detail.

The User Guide has some text styled in different ways to signify different meanings:

* kbd:[TEXT] : denotes keyboard buttons you might need to press. +
* <<TEXT>> : denotes links to other parts of the document or links that need to be opened in the browser.

See <<Quick Start>> for instructions on how to install our application.

If you are ready to use the application and want to know more about the CLI commands offered by ContactSails, you can jump to <<Features>>.

== Using ContactSails

This section first describes the various components of ContactSails' User Interface and later explains some guidelines you will need to follow to execute commands.

=== ContactSails User Interface

This section briefly explains the various panels in the UI interface of ContactSails.

[.text-center]
.Breakdown of ContactSails UI.
image::ContactSails_Interface_Breakdown.png[width="800" align="center"]

With reference to Figure 2 above, there are 5 important sections in the interface:

. *Command Box*: This is the place for you to type your commands. Pressing kbd:[Enter] will execute the command.
. *Result Display*: This place shows the result of the command you have executed. It will display messages indicating whether your command has executed successfully or not.
If your command fails to execute, error messages indicating the cause of the failure will be shown here.
. *Person List Panel*: This panel displays the list of persons that exist in ContactSails. You can filter this list of persons with `find` commands.
. *Center Panel*: This panel can display either a detailed display of a person's information, or a calendar.
The `select` command will display the selected person's information, and the `calendar` command will display the calendar.
. *Right Panel*: This panel can display either a list of orders or a list of calendar entries in ContactSails. On startup, this panel will show the list of orders by default.
You can use `orderlist` and `entrylist` to switch between the two lists.

Person List Panel, Center Panel and Right Panel will be explained in greater detail in <<Features>>.

=== Command Format Guidelines

Here are some guidelines you will have to take note of to execute commands in ContactSails:

. Command words are case sensitive.
** Typing `help` will execute the help command.
** Typing `Help`, or `HELP` will not execute the help command.
. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
** For example, in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
. Items in square brackets are optional.
** For example, `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/friend` or simply as `n/John Doe`.
. Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times. They can be omitted as well i.e. used 0 times.
** For example, `[g/GROUP]...` can be used as `'{nbsp}'` (i.e. 0 times), as `g/friend`, or  as `g/friend g/family`, etc.
. Parameters can be in any order.
** For example, if the command format specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, entering `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` instead will also be acceptable.

[TIP]
*Command Autocompletion:* +
ContactSails will automatically complete the command you want to enter if you press the kbd:[Tab] key. +
For example, typing `ad` in the command box and then pressing kbd:[Tab] will automatically fill `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [g/GROUP]...[pr/PREFERENCE]` in the command box.
