== Introduction

_CoinBook_ is a desktop application that is made for users who prefer to work on a mouse-free environment where everything can be done through commands typed in with the keyboard. There is no need to click on visual components of the App to perform tasks. In other words, _CoinBook_ offers a command line interface with minimal [gloss]#<<gui,graphical user interface (GUI)>># dependence.

_Coinbook_ allows you to store a portfolio of your cryptocurrency purchases as well as track the latest price trends and news, in addition to providing various

[[Features]]
== Features

_CoinBook_ allows you to manage your coin accounts easily through the use of commands. All you need to do is type in the command, followed by its required or optional _parameters_, then press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.

.Terminology
****
The following terms are used in the feature list to refer to specific concepts.
[[spec]]
* Target
** Refers to the account or group to execute the command upon
** This is used in commands requiring a target coin, and can be any one of the coin's:
*** `INDEX`: Its index number in the current coin listing
*** `CODE`: The trading code of the coin, e.g. `BTC`
*** `NAME`: The name of the coin, e.g. `Bitcoin`, and is case-insensitive [Coming in v2.0]
* Option/Parameter
** Refers to the additional information you must provide for the command
** These have a letter representing the option, followed by a slash (`/`), followed by the desired value
** The name of the option follows each letter. You should replace this with the desired value, e.g. `t/TAG` indicates the desired value of the tag should be typed after `t/`
****

.Command Format
****
Each command comes with a specific _format_ consisting of one or more parts. Please note the following conventions:

* Command parts denoted in `UPPERCASE` should be supplied by the user
* Parts in square brackets are optional, e.g.
`TARGET [t/TAG]`
can be used as either `BTC t/fav` or `BTC`
* Parts with `...` after them can be used zero or more times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cheap`, `t/active t/fav`, etc.
* If an option without `...` is used multiple times, only the rightmost value that you typed will be used, e.g. use of `c/CODE` as `c/BTC c/ETH` will be taken as `c/ETH` only
* Parameters can be in any order, e.g. if the command specifies `t/TAG a/VALUE`, then `a/VALUE t/TAG` is also acceptable
* Parts in curly braces indicate multiple possibilities, e.g. we use <<spec,`TARGET`>> as shorthand for `{INDEX,NAME,CODE}`

* For example:
** `p/+1000`: Current price rose $1000

****

You can click on the notification pop-up to jump quickly to the coin account that triggered it.

.Examples
----
notify h/>0
----
Notify when the amount held in an account is more than 0 after the update. This always triggers and hence is useless on its own, but can be combined with other conditions to restrict notifications to a smaller set of accounts

----
notify c/BTC w/=50
----
Notify when the amount worth in dollars of the `BTC` account is $50

----
notify w/+>1000 c/ETH
----
Notify when the amount worth in dollars of the `ETH` account rises by more than $1000

// tag::order[]

=== Change listing order `order` | `o` `[Since v1.5]`

.Format
----
order {a,z}
----

Orders the coin listing in lexicographical order or reverse lexicographical order. +
Put `a` after the command word to sort it in lexicographical order, and `z` to sort in reverse lexicographical order. The listing is sorted by the leftmost entered option first, then equal values are sorted by the next one, and so on.

The default order is lexicographical order of the coin names (i.e., option `a`).

.Examples

 order a

Sort the listing in lexicographical order (default option, whether "a" is added after the command word or not).

 order z

Sort the listing in reverse lexicographical order.

[WARNING]

This command can be reversed with `undo`, but only in the same session. The effect is permanent once _CoinBook_ is closed.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo previous command `undo` | `z`

.Format
----
undo
----

Restores the data to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed.

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: Commands that modify the data (`buy`, `sell`, `tag` and `clear`)
====

.Examples
----
buy BTC a/10 <1>
list
undo <1>
----
This reverses the `buy BTC a/10` command.
----
view 1
list
undo
----
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.
----
sell BTC a/10 <2>
clear <1>
undo <1>
undo <2>
----
The first `undo` reverses the `clear` command, the second reverses the `sell BTC a/10` command.

=== Redo undone command `redo` | `y`

.Format
----
redo
----

Reverses the most recent `undo` command.

.Examples
----
buy BTC a/10 <1>
undo <1><2>
redo <2>
----
<1> Reverses the `buy BTC a/10` command, and
<2> Reapplies it

The result is as if only the first line was executed.

----
list
redo
----
The command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
----
sell BTC a/10 <2>
clear <1>
undo <1><4>
undo <2><3>
redo <3>
redo <4>
----
This sequence of commands:

<1> Reverses the `clear` command
<2> Reverses the `sell BTC a/10` command
<3> Reapplies the `sell BTC a/10` command, and finally
<4> Reapplies the `clear` command

The result is as if only the first two lines were executed. Notice how the order of redoing is opposite from the undoing.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sync[]
=== Sync with price server `sync` | `sy` `[Since v1.5]`

.Format
----
sync
----

Obtains the latest price data to update price metrics of all owned coins.

[NOTE]
 You may notice some coins disappearing from the list view after syncing. This is most likely because the relevant coins no longer satisfy the currently applied list filter. +
 Run the `list` command if you wish to see all coins.

// end::sync[]

//tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete `[Since v1.5]`

Pressing any key will auto-suggest the field with all possible matching inputs.

Pressing the kbd:[UP] and kbd:[DOWN] arrow keys will allow navigation of the input suggestions.

Once the desired command is selected as indicated by light grey highlight, pressing the kbd:[ENTER] key will input the command into the command box.
//end::autocomplete[]

=== Exit the program : `exit` | `q`

.Format
----
exit
----

Exits the program.

[WARNING]
 After exiting the program, any changes made in the session will not be undoable with the `undo` command in the next session.

=== Save data

_CoinBook_ data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous _CoinBook_ folder  (default location: `data/`).
