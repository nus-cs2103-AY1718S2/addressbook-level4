By: `Team W14-B3`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up


. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later

+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::rate[]
=== Rate Command
==== Current Implementation
The `rate` command allows Talent Acquisition Specialists to evaluate candidates' performance in interviews against four specific criteria, namely technical skills, communication skills, problem solving skills and experience. The format of this command is `rate INDEX t/TECHNICAL SKILLS SCORE c/COMMUNICATINO SKILLS SCORE p/PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS SCORE e/EXPERIENCE SCORE`.

In our current implementation, the `rate` command inherits from the `UndoableCommand` class. Two components, `Logic` and `Model`, are involved in the execution of this command. The `Logic` component is responsible for parsing user inputs while the `Model` component deals with updating of filtered person list.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how these two components interact when the `rate` command is executed:

image::RateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.1.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `rate` command

As shown above, execution of the `rate` command comprises the following steps:

. `LogicManager` invokes `parseCommand` method of `AddressbookParser`, taking user inputs as arguments.
. During the `parseCommand` method call, an instance of `RateCommandParser` will be created when the keyword "rate" is matched. `RateCommandParser` then extracts the remaining user inputs and a `RateCommand` instance `r` will be returned provided that the format of user's input is correct.
. `LogicManager` then calls `executeUndoableCommand` of the `RateCommand`, `r`, instantiated in step 2. Another component, `Model`, will be involved as the `RateCommand` requests to update the rating scores of the person.
. The `Model` component gets the filtered persons list and replaces `Person` p1 with `Person` p2 which is identical to p2 except rating scores. A `CommandResult` will be generated and returned to `LogicManager`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of adding and editing rating scores

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a new command class `RateCommand` that supports adding rating scores and `RatingEditCommand` to handle editing of rating scores
** Pros: Results in more customisable commands that can be easily modified to support more prefixes and additional rating criteria
** Cons: Complicates the system as users need to familiarise themselves with more commands
* **Alternative 2:** Extend the original `EditCommand` to allow it to add and modify rating scores of a student
** Pros: Minimises the number of commands users have to remember to execute tasks, making the application more user-friendly
** Cons: Requires substantial changes to `EditCommandParser` and hence harder to implement
// end::rate[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Command
==== Current Implementation
The `sort` command supports the listing of students in HR+ based on GPA, name or overall rating in ascending or descending order as specified by the user. The format of this `sort` command is `sort FIELD o/SORT ORDER`.

As sorting is not undoable, this command inherits from the `Command` class instead of the `UndoableCommand` class. The sorting mechanism is mainly facilitated by `Logic` and `ModelManager`. `SortCommandParser` residing in `LogicManager` processes user inputs and creates a corresponding `SortCommand`. `ModelManager` will then invoke appropriate sorting methods in `UniquePersonList`.

The following sequence diagrams depict the interactions between `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` when a user issues a request for sorting:

image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence diagrams for execution of `sort` command

As seen from the sequence diagram above, `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` interact in the following way:

. When a user keys in `sort gpa o/desc`, `LogicManager` calls method `parser` in `AddressBookParser`.
. `SortCommandParser` is instantiated. If the user input is of the correct format, a `SortCommand` will be successfully created and returned back to `LogicManager`. Suppose the inputs are not valid or the format of the command is invalid, an exception will be thrown and users will see an error message.
. `LogicManager` proceeds to invoke `execute` method of `SortCommand`.
. `ModelManager` is in charge of sorting the list of persons through calling relevant methods provided in `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonList` according to the field to be sorted by.

Currently, HR+ only allows users to sort the list of students by selected fields in ascending or descending order. This is achieved by encapsulating acceptable sorting orders and fields into `SortOrder` and `SortField` of the type `enum` respectively.

In order to make Person objects comparable, additional methods need to be implemented in the `Person` class to compare different `Person` objects based on GPA, name and rating scores. The following code snippet demonstrates how these methods are implemented:
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Compares the overall ratings of two {@code Person} objects.
 * @param p1
 * @param p2
 * @return 1 if p1 has a higher overall rating, 0 if p1 and p2 have equal overall rating and -1 otherwise.
 */
public static int compareByOverallRating(Person p1, Person p2) {
    return Double.compare(p1.getRating().getOverallScore(),
            p2.getRating().getOverallScore());
}
----

To sort the list based on a particular field, we used the `sort` method from Java's `Collections` library. An example usage is shown below:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Sorts the list based on GPA in ascending order
 */
public void sortPersonsGradePointAverageAsc() {
    Collections.sort(internalList, Person::compareByGradePointAverage);
}

/**
 * Sorts the list based on GPA in descending order
 */
public void sortPersonsGradePointAverageDesc() {
    Collections.sort(internalList, Person::compareByGradePointAverage);
    Collections.reverse(internalList);
}
----

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: Implementation of `SortCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a more generic `SortCommand` that sorts the list of students based on parameters supplied by the user
** Pros: It is easier to modify `SortCommand` to support more fields to be sorted by.
** Cons: It restricts the format of sort command to be the same and is thus less flexible.
* **Alternative 2:** Use separate commands for each possible field, such as `gpa-sort`, `rating-sort` and `name-sort` commands
** Pros: It allows developers to specify different command formats. For example, users might not need to specify the sorting order explicitly. `rating-sort` and `gpa-sort` can have default sorting order to be descending while results from `name-sort` can be in ascending order.
** Cons: It increases the number of commands in HR+ and might be less user-friendly as users need to familiarise themselves with more commands.
// end::sort[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::findcommand[]
=== Find Command

==== Current Implementation

The `find` command is facilitated by an `AllPredicate` class, which composes of predicates that determine the fields that are supported. Each field has its own set of predicates that determine the types of search patterns the user can perform. Search results of the keywords are stored in `FindResults`, which is a singleton pattern class.

The following diagram, Figure 3.4.1.1 shows the composition of the `AllPredicate` class and the relationship between `FindResults`:

image::AllPredicateComposition.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.4.1.1 Composition of `AllPredicate` class

The following code snippet shows an example of one type of predicate:

[source,java]
----
public boolean test(Person person) {
    return keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> FindResults.getInstance()
                    .containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword,
                    commandPrefix)
                || keywords.stream()
                    .anyMatch(fuzzyKeyword ->
                    FindResults.getInstance().containsFuzzyMatchIgnoreCase(
                            person.getName().fullName, fuzzyKeyword, commandPrefix,
                            FindCommand.LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD)));
}
----

The following sequence diagrams, Figure 3.4.1.2 and Figure 3.4.1.3 shows how the `find` command works:

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.4.1.2 Sequence diagram of `find` command (1st part)

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.4.1.3 Sequence diagram of `find` command (2nd part)

The execution of the find command comprises the following steps:

1. `LogicManager` invokes `parseCommand` method of `AddressbookParser`, taking user inputs as arguments.

2. `AddressbookParser` calls the `parse` method of `FindCommandParser` to parse the arguments and return a `FindCommand` object.

3. `FindCommandParser` calls the `parseFindArgs` method of `FindUtil` , which calls either the `parseAllPredicates` or `parseSelectedPredicates` method from `PredicateUtil` depending on whether the argument starts with a prefix.

4. The `FindCommand` object is initialized with a combined `Predicate<Person>` object.

5. The `FindCommand` object calls the method `updateFilteredPersonList` with the `Predicate<Person>` object.

The following code snippets show how methods `formOrPredicate` and `formAndPredicate` are implemented:
[source,java]
----
public final Predicate<Person> formOrPredicate(Predicate<Person>... predicates) {
    return Stream.of(predicates).filter(Objects::nonNull)
            .reduce(condition -> false, Predicate::or);
}

public final Predicate<Person> formAndPredicate(Predicate<Person>... predicates) {
    return Stream.of(predicates).filter(Objects::nonNull)
            .reduce(condition -> true, Predicate::and);
}
----

The following sequence diagram, Figure 3.4.1.4, shows how the `Logic` component retrieves search results from `FindResults` without interference from the `Model` component:

image::FindCommandComponents.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.4.1.4 Component interactions for `find` command

[NOTE]
Note how results are retrieved from `FindResults`. It is important to have `FindResults` as a singleton pattern class as there should only be one instance of search results for every search performed by the `find` command.

The following activity diagram, Figure 3.4.1.5 summarizes what happens when an user executes the `find` command:

image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.4.1.5 Activity diagram when user executes `find` command

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: Implementation of find command

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Each field has its own field predicate composing of the predicates corresponding to the search pattern. The `AllPredicate` class is used to manage all these field predicates.

** Pros: It is easy for new developers to understand. New developers can test each predicate easily, resulting in the debugging process to be smoother. They can also add or remove new predicates of each field easily as all predicates all grouped separately. This choice also adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Separation of Concerns (SoC).

** Cons: It results in a lot of classes to be created. Although there is increased cohesion, there is also increased coupling. Furthermore, this choice also violates Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

* *Alternative 2*: Merge all predicates into one class

** Pros: It is easy for new developers to manage this command. This choice also reduces the amount of code written significantly.

** Cons: It is difficult to test existing and new predicates. This choice decreases cohesion although it decreases coupling.


==== Aspect: Implementation of Levenshtein distance threshold

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Set a private static constant

** Pros: It does not involve user intervention to set the threshold. It also decreases the chances of an increase in false positives should the user set a high threshold.

** Cons: It does not allow users to set their desired threshold. Some users might need specific threshold to suit their needs

* *Alternative 2*: Allow users to set their own threshold

** Pros: It caters to more users with specific preferences.

** Cons: It results in more implementation and tests to be written.
//end::findcommand[]

//tag::filtercommand[]
=== Filter Command

==== Current Implementation

Filter Command is supported by an `FilterCommand` class. It supports the advanced filtering of multiple fields such as `ExpectedGraduationYear`. Filter commands can supports both filtering by keyword and filtering by range, if the field has natural ordering.

Filter command currently only filters `ExpectedGraduationYear` but will support more fields in the subsequent weeks.

Filter command interact with `Model` and `UI` in the following way:

. `FilterCommandParser` parses the user inputs into a wholesome `Predicate<Person>`.
. This predicate will be used to instantiate the `FilterCommand`
. Upon execution of the filter command, the UI will be updated by imposing the new predicate to the `FilteredList` in the `ModelManager` class.

Below is the sequence diagram of filter command.

image::FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of `FilterCommandParser`
* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: `FilterCommandParser` breaks down user input according to prefix and pass to different methods in `FilterUtil` to generate respective `Predicate<Person>`, after which it unions these `Predicate`.

** Pros: This appoach breaks down the parsing process into multiple classes and each class is responsible for single duty. This makes debugging easier.

** Cons: New developers may find it hard to understand the design pattern.

* *Alternative 2*: Puts actual parsing in `FilterCommandParser` class.

** Pros: It reduces number of classes used and is easier for new developers to understand.

** Cons: It violates single responsibility principle. `FilterCommandParser` will have too many distinct functionalities such as
*** breaking down user input by prefix
*** breaking down user's predicate for each prefix
*** creating `FilterRange` objects to record down each range specified in the predicate
*** creating `Predicate` from `FilterRange`
*** unioning these `Predicate`

===== Aspect: Implementation of range tracker: `FilterRange<E>`
* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: All user input will either be in form of `ToBeFilteredClassPrefix/singletonValue, lowerRange - higherRange`. Both singleton value and range will be parsed into a `FilterRange<ToBeFilteredClass>`.
** Pros: It ensures the user input is valid since `FilterRange<E>` can call `E.isValid()` to check. This ensures the integrity of `Predicate` later.

** Cons: New developers may find it hard to understand the design pattern.

* *Alternative 2 (current choice)*: All parsing of singleton or ranged values will be handled by some methods in `FilterUtil`.
** Pros: New developers will find it easier to understand the design pattern.

** Cons: It will be messy to handle both singletona dn ranged values in one method. It also adds the complexity of `FilterUtil` class.

===== Aspect: `FilterCommand` behaviour
* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Predicates in the same field will be ORed together. Predicates in the different field will be ANDed together.
** Pros: For the same field, the user can have more flexibility in selecting the desired values. For the different field, the predicates are in logical conjunction to make the filter more restrictive. This follows the natural way of human thinking.

** Cons: The developers may be confused about the OR/AND rule at first.

* *Alternative 2*: Everything will be ORed together.
** Pros: It is an easier logical pattern for developers to understand.

** Cons: It is user unfriendly. The only way for user to filter the persons who is in Computer Science, graduating in 2020 and has a GPA greater than 4.6 is to use 3 filter commands.

=== Interview Command

==== Current Implementation

The `interview` command allows Talent Acquisition Specialists to schedule an interview for candidates. The format of this command is `interview INDEX DATE_TIME_EXPRESSION`.

This command make use of Natty, a natural language date parser library written in Java. When given a date expression, it will apply standard language recognition and translation techniques to produce `LocalDateTime` which represents the result.

In our current implementation, the `interview` command inherits from the `UndoableCommand` class. Two components, `Logic` and `Model`, are involved in the execution of this command. The `Logic` component is responsible for parsing user inputs while the `Model` component deals with updating of filtered person list.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how these two components interact when the `interview` command is executed:

image::InterviewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.6.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `interview` command

As shown above, execution of the `interview` command comprises the following steps:

. `LogicManager` invokes `parseCommand` method of `AddressbookParser`, taking user inputs as arguments.
. During the `parseCommand` method call, an instance of `InterviewCommandParser` will be created when the keyword "interview" is matched. `InterviewCommandParser` then extracts the remaining user inputs and a `InterviewCommand` instance `i` will be returned provided that the format of user's input is correct.
. `LogicManager` then calls `executeUndoableCommand` of the `InterviewCommand`, `i`, instantiated in step 2. Another component, `Model`, will be involved as the `InterviewCommand` requests to update the interview date of the person.
. The `Model` component gets the filtered persons list and replaces `Person` p1 with `Person` p2 which is identical to p2 except interview date. A `CommandResult` will be generated and returned to `LogicManager`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Usage of natural language parser

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the natural language parser library by Natty to specify date and time
** Pros: Users are able to enter the date and time in more natural tone without looking at calendar (For example, schedule an interview next Friday at 3pm)
** Cons: Natural language parser doesn't have 100% reliability due to the complexity of human language

* **Alternative 2:** Use the typical DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM format to specify date and time
** Pros: Users are able to specify the date and time precisely
** Cons: Users have to be certain on the date and time, which have to refer to the calendar at the same time

===== Aspect: Implementation of scheduling and editing interview date

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a new command class `InterviewCommand` that supports both scheduling and editing of interview date.
** Pros: Results in more customisable and modular command that can be easily modified
** Cons: Complicates the system as users need to familiarise themselves with more commands

* **Alternative 2:** Extend the original `EditCommand` to allow it to schedule and modify interview date of a candidate
** Pros: Minimises the number of commands users have to remember to execute tasks, making the application more user-friendly
** Cons: Requires substantial changes to `EditCommandParser` and hence harder to implement
// end::interview[]



// tag::userinterface[]
=== User Interface

Our user interface is specially designed to maximise HR+’s usability and improve user experience. We take into account minor details and ensure that data is presented clearly so that it appeals to our users.

The following sections discuss the different aspects we have considered to make sure HR+ follows industry standards in user interface design. Our implementation follows https://material.io[Material Design] principles created by a leading technology company Google.

==== Responsive Design

Responsive design is an approach to provide optimal viewing experience of an application regardless of the screen size of the user’s device. To incorporate responsive design into HR+, we use `AnchorPane` , a built-in JavaFX container component, to support relative positioning for all four directions (left, right, top and down) between parent and child components.

All UI components have a minimum size requirement. Therefore, every container component in HR+ has a `minWidth` property.

Besides `AnchorPane` , we also set a listener on the size of `InfoPanel` - a panel that displays detailed information about a student in HR+. The following code snippets illustrate how this listener is implemented:

[source,java]
----
// SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH is a constant to define when to trigger the merge

infoPaneWrapper.widthProperty().addListener((obs, old, newValue) -> {
    int width = newValue.intValue();
    if (width >= SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH) {
        // Split into two parts
    } else {
        // Merge into one part
    }
});
----

When a user runs HR+ on a device with a bigger screen size, the `InfoPanel` will be split into two parts. The left panel will display student’s information while the right panel shows the student’s rating scores and a View resume button. The figure below (Figure 3.7.1.1) shows an example of our interface on devices with larger screens:

image::userinterface/responsive_split.png[width="500"]
Figure 3.7.1.1 InfoPanel on devices with larger screens

On the other hand, if the device has a smaller screen size, the two components of `InfoPanel` will collapse into one. The student’s information is on top of the student’s ratings. `ScrollPane` in `InfoPanel` allows the user to scroll through the single merged panel. The figure below (Figure 3.7.1.2) shows our sample interface on devices with smaller screens:

image::userinterface/responsive_merge.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.1.2 InfoPanel on devices with smaller screens

==== Consistency

Consistency is another principle that is important in life and in design. Not only it brings up the professional feel and look, users will feel that the app is more reliable and robust. Besides that, it is easier for users to get started as the app follows a consistent pattern.

In order to follow this principle, we have used consistent color, layout and also fonts throughout the whole app. It will be discussed the in details below:

===== Color

The primary color in HR+ is blue, with 10 shades of blue in the figure illustrated below (Figure 3.7.2.1). Other than the primary color, different shades of grey are also being used to show the level of significance of an information. Besides that, the colors that are being used are harmonized such that it brings up an unified feeling while users are using the app.

image::userinterface/blue_shades.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.2.1 10 shades of blue used in HR+

===== Layout

The spacing and layout inside HR+ is consistent and balanced. We make good use of spacing to achieve grouping of elements so that legibility is improved. This allow users to have a sense of which information are relevant to each other.

For example, it is easy to separate between the applicant's information, contact information and interview information at a glance without the need of boxes. Examples are shown in the figure below (Figure 3.7.2.2)

image::userinterface/spacing_group.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.2.2 Grouping with spacing

===== Fonts

The font family that is being used is Roboto. It follows a natural width that allows text to be read more fluently. Moreover, this font featured 6 different weights (thin, light, regular, medium, bold and black) which will allow text to be represented depending on the different level of importance. All different weights are shown in the figure below. (Figure 3.7.2.3)

image::userinterface/roboto_weight.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.2.3 Different weights of Roboto font

Important information is usually shown with a higher weight whereas trivial information is shown with a lower weight. This allow users to skim through the information to process data easily. The fonts are stored in `resources/fonts` folder and embedded into the packaged app so that it can be loaded on all devices.

==== Familiarity

Familiarity is another aspect that is useful when designing an app. It can reduce the cognitive load of a user so that users will not feel overwhelmed by the information that is being displayed.

In HR+, icons are used to represent some of the fields. For example, stars are used to represent average rating of an applicant in the PersonCard list on the left (Figure 3.7.3.1, pointed with red arrow).

image::userinterface/familiar_star.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.3.1 Rating icon in PersonCard

Besides that, contact information fields such as e-mail, address and mobile phone number uses a familiar icon. (Figure 3.7.3.2)

image::userinterface/familiar_icons.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.3.2 Contact information icons in InfoPanel

==== Visual Feedback

Visual Feedback is also essential for users to identify the current state of the app. This is because user might get interrupted while using the app and have to resume the session at any time.

In HR+, when an applicant is selected in the PersonCard list on the left panel, it will be highlighted in blue border and shadow so that users know who they are currently selecting. (Figure 3.7.4.1)

image::userinterface/list_active.png[width="300"]
Figure 3.7.4.1 Highlighting of selected PersonCard

Besides that, there is an indication when a panel is selected. This allows users to traverse between panel using keyboard only. (Figure 3.7.4.2)

image::userinterface/panel_active.png[width="500"]
Figure 3.7.4.2 Highlighting of selected Panel

Moreover, when a command entered in `CommandBox` is invalid, the text color will be changed into red to indicate that there is an error in the command itself. (Figure 3.7.4.3)

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
