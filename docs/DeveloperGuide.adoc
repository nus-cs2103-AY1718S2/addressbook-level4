By: `Team F14-B3`      Since: `Mar 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

=== What is Investigapptor
Investigapptor is desktop application for a team of professional
investigators to easily manage crime cases that have been
delegated to them.

=== Core Team
Investigapptor was deveoped and is continually being maintained and
improved upon by link:teamURL[Team F14-B3].

== About this Developer Guide
This developer guide serves to assist you in making contributions to
Investigapptor. To get started, jump to <<Setting Up>>.

== Setting Up
Follow the instructions below to set up and configure `Investigapptor`
project files on your computer.

=== Prerequisites
Investigapptor requires you to have the following programs installed
in order for you to work on it further.

- *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later.
+
[TIP]
If you do not
already have it installed, you can download it from
link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[here].
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

- *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
To setup Investigapptor on IntelliJ, follow the steps below.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup
To verify that the setup is completed, you should

. Run the `seedu.investigapptor.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
This subsection would guide you through in setting up certain configurations
that you may find useful as you work on this project. It is highly recommended
that you make these configurations before you write any code.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-F14-B3/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-F14-B3/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design
This section will explain structure of the Investigapptor and what each component of the
Investigapptor does. With a clear understanding of the design, it becomes much easier for you
to identify where and how your enhancement should be implemented.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* as shown in <<ArcDiagram, Architecture Diagram>>
 below explains the high-level design of the Application.
 Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[[ArcDiagram]]
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]


[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the
link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for:

* At Investigapptor launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the Investigapptor's log file.

The rest of the Application consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the Application.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of Investigapptor in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletecase 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletecase 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteCase.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` when the Investigapptor data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `deletecase1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component


.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `CrimeCaseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InvestigapptorParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletecase 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletecase 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Investigapptor data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<CrimeCase>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Investigapptor data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.investigapptor.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Laying the Groundwork

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
==== Configuration

For starters, you can control certain properties of the application, such as:

* application name
* logging level

through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

==== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

==== Undo/Redo feature
===== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which
resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of
 commands that modifies the state of the Investigapptor (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


====== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


====== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

=== Functional Enhancements

// tag::password[]
==== Password feature
The password feature allows for the user to set a password
for the application. This password can then be disclosed only to
authorised users so as disallow unauthorised users from accessing
 or modifying the application data.

===== Current Implementation
This subsection will describe the current implementation of the password
feature. An overview of how the password feature is implemented can be
seen in the sequence diagram below:

[[HighLevelDiagram]]
.High Level Sequence Diagram of Password Feature
image::PasswordHighLevelSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

====== Logic Component

When a `setpassword` command is executed, a
link:{repoUrl}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/logic/commands/SetPasswordCommand.java[SetPasswordCommand]
object gets created if the parsing of the command was successful. This
will in turn make a call to the `updatePassword` function in the `Model`
component, as shown in the sequence diagram below:

[[LogicDiagram]]
.Password Feature's Logic Component Sequence Diagram
image::PasswordLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

====== Model Component

Upon being called, the `updatePassword` function in the
link:{repoUrl}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/model/ModelManager.java[ModelManager]
would raise a new `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` to indicate that the
password has been updated. The entire sequence diagram for the `Model`
component as shown below describes this in greater detail.

[[ModelDiagram]]
.Password Feature's Model Component Sequence Diagram
image::PasswordModelSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

Whenever then link:{repoUrl}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/model/Password.java[Password]
 Object's `updatePassword` function is called,
the <<hash, hash>> of the password is first generated with the `generatePasswordHash`
function. This function makes use of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2[SHA-256]
hashing algorithm as shown below:

[source, java]
----
public static String generatePasswordHash(String password) {
        String encodedHash = null;
        try {
            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
            digest.update(INITIAL_VALUE.getBytes());
            if (!isNull(password)) {
                byte[] byteHash = digest.digest(password.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
                encodedHash = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(byteHash);
            }
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException noSuchAlgoException) {
            System.out.println("Cannot generate hash: MessageDigest.getInstance");
        }
        return encodedHash;
    }

----

====== Storage Component
With regards to the password feature, the `Storage` component is responsible
not only for storing the currently set password, but also for checking whether
an input password is correct. If the input password is correct, a
`ValidPasswordEvent` is raised, as shown in the sequence diagram below:

[[StorageDiagram]]
.Password Feature's Storage Component Sequence Diagram
image::PasswordInputSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

===== Alternatives Considered
This subsection would describe other designs and implementations
that were taken into consideration.

====== Aspect: Usage of password feature
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Have a single password for the entire
application
** Pros: Investigators within a team can simply share the password.
** Cons: There is no access control between investigators of different
ranks.

* **Alternative 2 **: Have a separate password for each investigator.
** Pros: Each investigator can have their own password, allowing for
access control between investigators of different ranks.
** Cons: Requires an additional password attribute for each investigator.

====== Aspect: Password related commands being undoable
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Password related commands should not be
undoable
** Pros: Security becomes tighter.
** Cons: More effort is required in configuring passwords.

* **Alternative 2 **: Password related commands should be undoable.
** Pros: Less effort is required in configuring passwords.
** Cons: Security becomes less tight due to the additional method of
configuring passwords

// end::password[]

//tag::calendar[]
[[Calendar-Feature]]
//tag::calendar2[]
==== Calendar feature
The calendar feature serves as an interface to provide an overview of all the cases
present in the `CrimeCaseListPanel`. The entries are colour-coded according to its case's
status. Red represents the status `open`; whereas green represents the status `close`.

[[CalendarFeature]]
.Calendar Interface
image::CalendarFeature.PNG[width="700"]

===== Reason for implementation
The calendar serves as an organization tool to arrange the cases according to its start and end date,
and it also categorizes the cases by its current status. This feature is useful for the investigators as it provides them an overview of all the cases that they are looking for.
Having such an overview, the investigators can instantly identify all the required cases at a quick glance.

This feature not only brings in convenience for the investigators, it also eliminates the need of manual work in
scheduling existing cases. This thus improves the efficiency of the investigators as time will be spent on
significant events such as investigative work instead of bookkeeping tasks.

===== Current Implementation
The calendar graphical interface was implemented with an external library, https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX].
The calendar interface, `CalendarPanel` is part of the UI component which supports the view of the cases that are currently present
in the panel list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the components within the `CalendarPanel`
interacts with each other.

[[SDforCalendar]]
.Component interactions within `CalendarPanel`
image::SDForCalendar.png[width="800"]

The `CalendarPanel` comprises of the following attributes and objects:

* A `Calendar` object called `caseCloseCalendar` which stores the entries consisting of cases whose status is `close`
* A `Calendar` object called `caseOpenCalendar` which stores the entries consisting of cases whose status is `open`
* A `CalendarSource` object called `caseCalendarSource` which stores the calendars, `caseCloseCalendar` and `caseOpenCalendar`
* A `CalendarView` FXML object called `calendarPanel` which provides the graphical view (interface) of the calendar
* An `ObservableList<CrimeCase>` called `crimeList` that stores the current list of the crime cases

The `CalendarPanel` does event handling in order to keep its view updated with the list of
cases that is currently displayed on the `CrimeCaseListPanel`. Hence, when either one of the two events, `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` or `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent`
has been raised from the `EventsCenter`, the `CalendarPanel` will handle the event by updating the
`FilteredCrimeCaseList`. The following section below will illustrate in details
on how the event handling was carried out by `CalendarPanel`.

===== Events-Driven Entries
The entries displayed on the calendar will be changed according to the commands that were executed.

====== Event raised from data change in application
As mentioned in the <<Events, event-driven design section>>, the model will raise
an `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` to indicate that the data in the application has changed.
In the following sequence diagrams, it indicates how the components interacts when the user
enters the commands that changes the data in the investigapptor. (Commands are as shown in the diagrams).

====== Sequence Diagram for `addcase`
[[SDforAddCase]]
.Component interactions for `addcase 1` command
image::SDforAddCase.png[width="800"]
For the `addcase` command, when a new case has been added to the investigapptor, it will raise
an `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` which will update the calendar to reflect the newly added case.

====== Sequence Diagram for `deletecase`
[[SDforDeleteCase]]
.Component interactions for `deletecase 1` command
image::SDforDeleteCase.png[width="800"]
Similarly, for the `deletecase` command, when a case has been deleted from the investigapptor, it
will raise the `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` which will remove the case from the calendar.

====== Sequence Diagram for commands that updates the case's details
[[SDForUpdateCase]]
.Component interactions for commands that update the details of a case
image::SDforUpdateCase.png[width="800"]
As for `editcase` and `close` command, it will make changes to the details of the cases. When the
case is updated, the investigapptor will raise the `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` which will
update the calendar by displaying the updated entry.

====== Sequence Diagram for handling `InvestigapptorChangedEvent`
[[SDForInvestigapptorChangedEventHandling]]
.Handling `InvestigapptorChangedEvent`
image::SDForInvestigapptorChangedEventHandling.png[width="800"]

The <<SDForInvestigapptorChangedEventHandling, diagram above>> represents how the `EventsCenter`
reacts to the `InvestigapptorChangedEvent`.

When the commands mentioned in these diagrams - <<SDforAddCase, #1>>, <<SDforDeleteCase, #2>>, <<SDForUpdateCase, #3>>
are executed, the `InvestigapptorChangedEvent` will be raised and the function
`handleInvestigapptorChangedEvent` in `CalendarPanel` will be invoked. The function
would then re-initialize `crimeList` to the updated `crimeCaseList` and proceed to
update the calendar accordingly.

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleInvestigapptorChangedEvent(InvestigapptorChangedEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    crimeList = event.data.getCrimeCaseList();
    Platform.runLater(this::updateCalendar);
}
----
//end::calendar2[]

[[Calendar-Events-Filter]]
===== Event raised from filtering the `CrimeCase` list
In the following sequence diagram, it shows how the components interacts when the user issues
the commands that filters  the cases that the user is looking for. (Commands are shown in the diagram).

These commands does not change the data in the investigapptor, but it filters the cases that matches the keywords
predicate which is passed in as an parameter in `updateFilteredCrimeCaseList(keywords)`.
When the `FilteredCrimeCaseList` has been updated, it  will contain the cases that the user is looking for.

====== Sequence Diagram for commands that update `FilteredCrimeCaseList`

[[SDForFindCase]]

When these commands are executed, it will raise a `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent` which will
update the calendar with the cases that are currently in the `FilteredCrimeCaseList`.

====== Sequence Diagram for handling `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent`

The <<SDforFilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEventHandling, diagram above>> represents how the `EventsCenter`
reacts to the `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent`.

When the commands in the <<SDForFindCase>> is executed, it will update the `FilteredCrimeCaseList` in the
model component and the `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent` will be raised.
`handleFilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent` from `CalendarPanel` will be invoked which
updates the `crimeList` to the updated `FilteredCrimeCaseList`. It will then
update the calendar accordingly with the updated `crimeList`.

//tag::backup[]
==== Create backup

This feature allows users to create a new xml file of the current state of the Investigapptor
with a new name.

===== Reason for implementation

As investigators may want to save the current state of the Investigapptor before progressing
or having to create a periodic backup to fall back on.

===== Current implementation

The `BackupCommand` is created when the command word `backup` is detected in the user input. It will then use the `BackupCommandParser`
ensure that the filename is alphanumeric. The `BackupCommand` will then call the `backupInvestigapptor` method from the model
and pass in the filename as a string.

[[backup-diagram]]
.Backup Sequence Diagram
image::backupDiagram.png[width="790"]



In the `Model`, the `backUpInvestigapptor` will raise the event `InvestigapptorBackupEvent` .The event contains filename which will be passed to
Storage component to start the saving sequence.

    public void backUpInvestigapptor(String fileName) {
        raise(new InvestigapptorBackupEvent(investigapptor, fileName));
    }

At the Storage component, the `handleInvestigapptorBackupEvent` will extract the filename and create a new
xml by using the `backupInvestigapptor` method.

    public void handleInvestigapptorBackupEvent(InvestigapptorBackupEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event, "Backup command, saving to file"));
        try {
            backupInvestigapptor(event.data, event.fileName);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            raise(new DataSavingExceptionEvent(e));
        }
    }

=== Investigator Features

==== `investigator` Package

===== Reason for Implementation
As person class provided by the addressbook only has basic capability to store simple information such name and
phone number, we had to create a new `Investigator` package which can store and handle a list of `CrimeCases` which is a core
requirement for our product to work. We chose not to modify the `Person` package but instead extend from it as it will be easier
for you to implement new type of person object in the future such as suspects or witnesses.

===== Current Implementation
Currently the `Investigator` extends from the `Person` class, and the additional two properties the are:

[width="100%", cols="11,10,20,20", options="header"]
|=======
|Composition Of |Class |Constructor |Remark
|Person |Name |`new Name(“Jon Doe”)` |Stores a `String` that represents the name of the person.
|Person |Phone |`new Phone(9123874)` |Stores an `int` that represents the phone number of the person.
|Person |Email |`new Email(“JohnD@gmail.com”)` |Stores a `String` that represents the email of the person.
|Person |Address |`new EndDate("Baker Street #01-04")` |Stores a `String` that represents the address of the person.
|Investigator |Rank |`new Status('1')` |Store a `String` that represent a int value that can be converted to the appropriate <<Rank>>.
|Investigator |UniqueCrimeCaseList |`new Status()` | Stores a `UniqueCrimeCaseList` that contains all the cases the investigator is in charged of
|=======

[[Rank]]

* `Rank`
+
Stores the rank of the investigator

[width="50%",cols="15%,<30%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Integer Value |Rank
|`1` |`Constable`

|`2` |`Sergeant`

|`3` |`Inspector`

|`4` |`Detective`

|`5` |`Captain`

|=======================================================================


* `UniqueCrimeCaseList`
+
Stores and manages all the CrimeCases which the investigator is in charge of.

===== Model

Currently the `Investigator` is upcasted and stored in the `Investigapptor` 's `UniquePersonList`.
This is done on purpose to allow future enhancement that allows us to implement types of people such as suspects and witnesses. Storing them together makes it easier to use general
functions.

[invest-com]
.Investigator in Model Component
image::investigatorComponent.png[width="790"]

The code below is from the `syncWithMasterTagList` function. It shows that
both Investigator and Person type are both return into the `UniquePersonList`.

===== Storage

As Investigator has addition properties compared to Person, `XmlAdaptedInvestigator` is created to convert
the `Investigator` into correct XML format. We had to also change the method of storing the in `Investigapptor`
the different classes have to be converted and stored in the correct format. To accomplish this,
two new methods were added which each return a person only list and a investigator only list to store them
separately

This function will return only `Investigator` in the list

    public ObservableList<Investigator> investigatorList() {
        Iterator irt = iterator();
        ObservableList<Investigator> investigators = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
        while (irt.hasNext()) {
            Object element = irt.next();
            if (element instanceof Investigator) {
                investigators.add((Investigator) element);
            }
        }
        return investigators;
    }

This function will only return `Person` in the list

    public ObservableList<Person> personOnlyList() {
        Iterator irt = iterator();
        ObservableList<Person> persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
        while (irt.hasNext()) {
            Object element = irt.next();
            if (!(element instanceof Investigator)) {
                persons.add((Person) element);
            }
        }
        return persons;
    }

As the `Investigator` has to store multiple `CrimeCase` , instead of store the whole `CrimeCase` and all
its details inside of the `XmlAdaptedInvestigator`, we stored the hashcode instead to
reduce the amount of space used for storage.

===== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Interaction between Investigator and CrimeCase

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use mutual reference between Investigator and CrimeCase
** Pros: Easy and fast to find relation between Investigator and CrimeCase by using the reference
** Cons: Hard to implement due to the undo/redo feature due to creating multiple `Investigapptor` hence the reference
has to be correct for each instance.
* **Alternative 2:** Using Association class
** Pros: Easier to implement. More compatible with the undo/redo feature
** Cons: Slower due to having to search through all the association class to find all all the connected
 `Investigator` and `CrimeCase`. More duplicates in the XML file.

//end::investigator[]

//tag::addinvestigator[]
==== Add investigator

The `addInvestigatorCommand` will create an instance of the Investigator class and store it in the Investigapptor.

===== Reason for Implementation

The `addInvestigatorCommand` is important as you would want to be able to add your own investigator details into the
investigapptor before you can start editing and managing with the other commands.

===== Current Implementation
The `addInvestigatorCommand` is created when the command word `addinvestigator` is detected in the user input. It will then use the `ParserUtil`
to split the user input into its separate components (i.e. `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Rank`, `Set<Tag>`). The
add investigator command will then create a Investigator instance and pass it from the logic component to the model component as shown
in <<add-investLogic>>.

[[add-investLogic]]
.Add Investigator Logic Diagram
image::AddInvestigatorLogicDiagram.png[width="790"]

When initialising Investigapptor, the storage using the `addPerson()` method as well to populate the
Investigapptor thus it has to be able to correctly set up the reference to the `CrimeCase`. To do this,
when a `investigator` is added to Investigapptor, it will check its list of `CrimeCase` hashcodes against
the all the `CrimeCase` in the Investigapptor and add those that match into its list of `CrimeCase`.
Only after adding the `CrimeCase` will the investigator be stored in the `persons` list as show in <<add-invest>>.

[[add-invest]]
.Add Investigator Sequence Diagram
image::AddInvestigatorSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

Due to the Redo/Undo feature, multiple instance of the Investigapptor will be created which means the references may point to
the wrong instance. In order to fix this, hashcode is used to identify the correct the CrimeCase and set the correct reference.
This is done by the convertHashtoCases method in the Investigapptor as show below.

The methods below are used to match and add the `CrimeCase` to the `investigator`.

    private void convertHashToCases(Investigator key) {
        requireNonNull(key.getCaseListHashed());
        for (Integer i : key.getCaseListHashed()) {
            try {
                addCaseFromHash(key, i);
            } catch (DuplicateCrimeCaseException e) {
                throw new AssertionError("Not possible, duplicate case while retrieving from xml");
            }
        }
    }

    private void addCaseFromHash (Investigator key, int hash) throws DuplicateCrimeCaseException {
        for (CrimeCase c : cases) {
            if (c.hashCode() == hash) {
                key.addCrimeCase(c);
            }
        }
    }

===== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Setting up Reference between `Investigator` and `CrimeCase` when loading the XML

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using hashcode to reference `CrimeCase` when adding
** Pros: The `Investigator` will be able to find correct `CrimeCase` to reference despite having multiple instances.
Storage takes lesser space as only the hashcode is required.
** Cons: Have to scan every `CrimeCase` for each `CrimeCase` belonging to the Investigator.
* **Alternative 2: Saving the whole `CrimeCase` inside the XML
** Pros: Able to reference the correct `CrimeCase` after loading the XML.
** Cons: Takes up a lot of storage as two copy `CrimeCase` has to be saved, one in `UniqueCrimeCaseList`
and one in the `Investigator`.

//end::addinvestigator[]

//tag::deleteinvestigator[]

==== Delete investigator

The `deleteInvestigatorCommand` will find and delete the specified Investigator in the Investigapptor.

===== Reason for Implementation

The `deleteInvestigatorCommand` is important as you may not longer wish to store certain investigator or have made a mistake when
add the investigator.

===== Current Implementation
The `deleteInvestigatorCommand` is created when the command word `deleteinvestigator` is
detected in the user input. It will then check if the index given is valid. If the index
 is valid, it will check if the investigator at the index if it's `UniqueCaseList` is empty.
 If it is empty, it will call the `deletePerson` method from the `ModelManager`.

[[delete-investLogic]]
.Delete Investigator Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteInvestigatorLogic.png[width="790"]

The `ModelManager` will then call
`Investigapptor` 's `deletePerson` method which will remove the investigator from the
`persons` as show below in <<delete-invest>>.

[[delete-invest]]
.Delete Investigator Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteInvestigatorSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

===== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Method of removing investigator

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Fully delete the investigator
** Pros: Easy to implement, no further issues after deleting the investigator.
** Cons: No longer able to retrieve it after deleted, other than undo.
* **Alternative 2:** Archive the investigator
** Pros: Able bring any investigator out of archive.
** Cons: Complicated to implement, does not actually delete the investigator and may cause build up of unwanted data.

//end::deleteinvestigator[]

//tag::editinvestigator[]

==== Edit investigator

The `EditInvestigatorCommand` will recreate an instance of the Investigator class that exist and store it in the Investigapptor.

===== Reason for Implementation

The `EditInvestigatorCommand` is important as you would want to be able to edit an investigator's details in the
investigapptor rather than having to delete and add a new investigator.

===== Current Implementation
The `EditInvestigatorCommand` is created when the command word `editinvestigator` is detected in the user input. It will then use the `ParserUtil`
to identify which detail is to be changed (i.e. `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Rank`, `Set<Tag>`). The `EditInvestigatorCommand`
will then create a Investigator instance using both the old and new information and pass it from the logic component to the model component.
As the logic for edit is extremely similar to add, you can refer to <<add-invest>> to view the logic diagram.

The model will take in both the old and new the Investigator instance and start by recreating the all the cases as they reference the old investigator has to
be updated. In order to do this, the `Investigapptor` will swap all the `CrimeCases` that belong to the investigator with a `CrimeCase` with the new `Investigator`.
Once all the `CrimeCases` are recreated, they will be added to new `Investigator` and the `Investigator` will be stored in the `persons` list.


[edit-invest]
.Editing Investigator Sequence Diagram
image::EditInvestigatorSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

Code snippet of how each case is recreated and swapped to ensure that the index is not changed.

    private void recreateCasesForInvestigator(Investigator inv, CrimeCase c) {
         CrimeCase newCase = syncWithMasterTagList(new CrimeCase(c.getCaseName(), c.getDescription(),
            inv, c.getStartDate(), c.getEndDate(), c.getStatus(), c.getTags()));
         try {
             cases.setCrimeCase(c, newCase);
         } catch (DuplicateCrimeCaseException e) {
             throw new AssertionError("Duplicate Case when editing investigator");
         } catch (CrimeCaseNotFoundException e) {
             throw new AssertionError("Case not found when editing investigator");
         }
     }


===== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Updating the `CrimeCases` referencing the `Investigator`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Recreate every `CrimeCase` with the new value
** Pros: By recreating the `CrimeCase`, we are able to set the `Investigator` to be final inside the `CrimeCase`.
This will help avoid bugs when redoing and undoing.
** Cons: Each edit requires more work as `CrimeCase` has to be remove and recreated.
* **Alternative 2:** Change `CrimeCase` 's investigator to be not final, so that direct change can be made.
** Pros: Easier to change the each CrimeCase as it does not need to be recreated.
** Cons: `Investigator` in `CrimeCase` will no longer be final. This however involve the `Invesetigator` to
modify `CrimeCase`, which result in bad coupling.

//end::editinvestigator[]

//tag::listinvestigatorcase[]

==== List investigator's cases

The `ListInvestigatorCaseCommand` will search and display all the cases belonging to the investigator in the panel list.

===== Reason for Implementation

The `ListInvestigatorCaseCommand` is important as you would want to be able find all the cases the investigator is in charge of
easily as compared to search each case one by one.

===== Current Implementation
The `ListInvestigatorCaseCommand` is created when the command word `listinvestigatorcases` is detected in the user input. It will then use the `ParserUtil`
to identify which investigator is selected by using the `Index`. `ListInvestigatorCaseCommand` will retrieve the selected `investigator`
from the `Model` and use its hashcode to create the `CaseContainsInvestigatorPredicate`. The
predicate will be used to filter the list of `CrimeCase` to only show `CrimeCase` that contain
the selected `investigator`. An event will be raised to alert the UI to swap over to show the `CrimeCase` panel list.

Code snippet of what is being done in the execute method

    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        if (targetIndex != null) {
            List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
            if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new
                CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_INVESTIGATOR_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }
            investigator = (Investigator) lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
            requireNonNull(investigator);
            predicate = new CaseContainsInvestigatorPredicate(investigator.hashCode());
        }
        model.updateFilteredCrimeCaseList(predicate);
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwapTabEvent(1));
        return new CommandResult(getMessageForCrimeCaseListShownSummary(model.getFilteredCrimeCaseList().size()));
    }



===== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Updating the `CrimeCases` referencing the `Investigator`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using predicate and filtered list
** Pros: The architecture for using predicate and filtered is already implemented and used for other
type of searches.
** Cons: Require to search every single `CrimeCase` to get the result.
* **Alternative 2:** Using the `investigator` 's list of `CrimeCase`
** Pros: Does not need to search every `CrimeCase` , meaning command will be processed faster
** Cons: Have to implement a method to convert the `investigator` 's list of `CrimeCase` to a filtered list.

//end::listinvestigatorcase[]

=== Case Features

//tag::crimecase[]
==== `crimecase` Package

===== Reason for implementation

As Investigapptor is a tool for managing investigations, the ability to store information about a case is essential.

===== Current implementation

Each attribute of a case, such as the case name, description, status, etc. are classes in the `crimecase` package. Each of the classes provide utility methods to check the validity of the string to be stored, retrieve the string that is stored, and obtain the hash code of the object.

The following classes have been introduced in the package as of v1.1:

[width="100%", cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Class |Constructor |Remark
|CaseName |`new CaseName(“Project Zero”)` |Stores a `String` that represents the name of the case.
|Description |`new Description(“Abduction and murder of a Chicago greeting card executive.”)` |Stores a `String` that represents the description of the case.
|StartDate |`new StartDate(“01/01/2015”)` |Stores a `String` that represents the start date of the case.
|EndDate |`new EndDate(LARGEST_DATE)` |Stores a `String` that represents the end date of the case.

The class contains a static string `LARGEST_DATE` that is often used as the default argument when instantiating the `EndDate` class to indicate a newly created case whose `Status` is “open”.
|Status |`new Status()` |Stores a `String` that represents the status of the case. The class only stores strings of value "open" or "close", with the default value set to "open" when the constructor is called.
|=======

The `crimecase` package includes the `CrimeCase` class which is used to keep information about a case. The `CrimeCase` class provides utility methods to retrieve the different objects (e.g. `CaseName`), delete a tag, and obtain the hash code of the `CrimeCase` object.

A `CrimeCase` class is created with one constructor.

[width="100%", cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Class |Constructor |Remark
|CrimeCase |`new CrimeCase(name, description, investigatorToAdd, startDate, endDate, status, tagList)` |Stores `CaseName`, `Description`, `Investigator`, `StartDate`, `Status`, and `UniqueTagList` objects to represent information of the case.
|=======

`CrimeCase` objects are considered "duplicates" when they share at least the same `CaseName`, `Description`, and `StartDate`.

===== Reasons for how it is implemented

The `crimecase` package follows the model of the `person` package, whereby each attribute is represented by a class. This allows for better organization and a modular design which follows the single responsibility principle.

//end::crimecase[]

//tag::addcase[]
==== Add case

===== Reason for implementation

To be able to manage cases, investigators should have the ability to add case details into the application.

===== Current implementation

====== Logic component

The `AddCaseCommandParser` parses the string of arguments provided by the user and splits the `String` into its separate components (i.e. `CaseName`, `Description`, `Index`, `StartDate`, `Set<Tag>`) to be used in the context of the `AddCaseCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown if the user input does not conform to the expected format.

The `AddCaseCommand` that extends the `UndoableCommand` class is implemented with constructor overloading, where either constructor can be used depending on the developer’s needs.

[width="100%", cols="1,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Constructor |Remark
|`new AddCaseCommand(crimeCase)` |Accepts a `CrimeCase` object as parameter.

Useful in testing where `CrimeCaseBuilder` is used to create the `CrimeCase` object first.
|`new AddCaseCommand(name, description, investigatorIndex, startDate, tagList)` |Accepts `CaseName`, `Description`, `Index`, `StartDate`, `Set<Tag>` objects as parameters.

Called by `AddCaseCommandParser` when a user inputs the command and details of a case.

When this constructor is used, the `Index` object is processed to retrieve the `Investigator` object at the specified index on the most recent list of investigators displayed by the model. A `CrimeCase` object is created using the parameters and the retrieved `Investigator` object.
|=======

The `CrimeCase` object is then added to the model and throws a `DuplicateCrimeCaseException` if there exists a similar object already in Investigapptor. The following snippet shows the execution code.

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    try {
        model.addCrimeCase(toAdd);
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
    } catch (DuplicateCrimeCaseException e) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_CASE);
    }
}
----

====== Model component

In the `Model` component, the new `CrimeCase` object gets added to the case list of the assigned investigator as well (i.e. `UniqueCrimeCaseList` within the `Investigator` object) via the `addCrimeCaseToInvestigator` method. This method traverses through the entire list of investigators to find the correct `Investigator` object to add the new `CrimeCase` object to. The code is shown below.

[source, java]
----
public void addCrimeCase(CrimeCase c) throws DuplicateCrimeCaseException {
    CrimeCase crimeCase = syncWithMasterTagList(c);
    if (cases.add(crimeCase)) {
        addCrimeCaseToInvestigator(crimeCase);
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens in the `Model` component when a case is added.

.Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `addcase` Command
image::SD_AddCaseCommand_Model.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Parsing the investigator-to-be-assigned

* **Alternative 1:** User inputs an investigator's name after the `i/` prefix to indicate who to assign the case to
** Pros: More intuitive for the user.
** Cons: More difficult to implement - need a way to decide which investigator to assign if they share identical names.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** User inputs the index of the investigator based on the case list after the `i/` prefix to indicate who to assign the case to
** Pros: Easier to implement and more straightforward. Index provided is the investigator to be assigned - don't have to worry about identical names.
** Cons: User would have to switch between lists to refer to the investigator index. For example, the user types the command to add the case but then realises that they needed the investigator index. They would have to either use the interface to switch the tabs or type the `listinvestigators` command. This disrupts the flow and hinders efficiency.
//end::addcase[]

//tag::deletecase[]
==== Delete case

===== Reason for implementation

Sometimes, cases are added by error or there is no need to continue management of a case. Investigators should have a method to remove a case from the application.

===== Current implementation

====== Logic component

The `DeleteCaseCommandParser` parses the string of arguments provided by the user to retrieve the index (i.e. `Index`) to be used in the context of the `DeleteCaseCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown if the user input does not conform to the expected format.

The `DeleteCaseCommand` extends the `UndoableCommand`.

[width="100%", cols="1,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Constructor |Remark
|`new DeleteCaseCommand(targetIndex)` |Accepts an `Index` object as parameter.

The `targetIndex` is processed to retrieve the `CrimeCase` object at the specified index on the most recent list of cases displayed by the model.
|=======

The `CrimeCase` object is then removed from the model. `EventsCenter` reacts to the `SwapTabEvent`, which switches the tab to show the list of cases. The following snippet shows the execution code.

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
    requireNonNull(caseToDelete);
    try {
        model.deleteCrimeCase(caseToDelete);
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwapTabEvent(1));
    } catch (CrimeCaseNotFoundException pnfe) {
        throw new AssertionError("The target case cannot be missing");
    }
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_CASE_SUCCESS, caseToDelete));
}
----

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the `Logic` component.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletecase 1` Command
image::SD_DeleteCaseCommand_Logic.png[width="800"]

====== Model component

The new `CrimeCase` object gets removed from the case list of the assigned investigator as well (i.e. `UniqueCrimeCaseList` within the `Investigator` object) via the `removeCrimeCaseFromInvestigator` method. This method traverses through the entire list of investigators to find the correct `Investigator` object to remove the `CrimeCase` object from. The code is shown below.

[source, java]
----
public boolean removeCrimeCase(CrimeCase key) throws CrimeCaseNotFoundException {
    if (cases.remove(key)) {
        removeCrimeCaseFromInvestigator(key);
        return true;
    } else {
        throw new CrimeCaseNotFoundException();
    }
}
----

The sequence diagram for the `Model` component is provided below.

.Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `deletecase 1` Command
image::SD_DeleteCaseCommand_Model.png[width="400"]
//end::deletecase[]

//tag::editcase[]
==== Edit case

===== Reason for implementation

Typos can be made when in a haste. The ability to edit cases would give investigators a chance to rectify these mistakes easily. This feature will also enable re-assignment of cases to other investigators, which is useful when an investigator can no longer work on a case.

===== Current implementation

====== Logic component

The EditCaseCommandParser parses the String of arguments provided by the user and splits the `String` into the case index (`Index`) and the separate components (i.e. `CaseName`, `Description`, `Index`, `StartDate`, `Set<Tag>`) and directs it into a `EditCrimeCaseDescriptor` object  to be used in the context of the `EditCaseCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown if the user input does not conform to the expected format.

The `EditCrimeCaseDescriptor` is a class containing information that describes the case (i.e. case name, description, investigator, start date, tags). The descriptor is used because the user is not required to input all the fields except the case index. When the user specifies the field they wish to edit, it sets the field in the `EditCrimeCaseDescriptor` to that value. If any field is not specified, the field is set to `null`.

The `EditCaseCommand` that extends the `UndoableCommand` has one constructor.

|Constructor |Remark
|`new EditCaseCommand(caseIndex, editCrimeCaseDescriptor)` |Accepts an `Index` object and `EditCrimeCaseDescriptor` as parameters.

The `caseIndex` is processed to retrieve the `CrimeCase` object at the specified index on the most recent list of cases displayed by the model.

A new `CrimeCase` object is created using the retrieved case-to-be-edited and the descriptor.
|=======

====== Model component

When the `EditCaseCommand` is executed, note that the original `CrimeCase` object is not modified, but rather, replaced by a new `CrimeCase` object. When the `CrimeCase` constructor is called, a new `Investigator` object without its `UniqueCrimeCaseList` is created within the `CrimeCase` (i.e. only the personal details are stored). This is to simplify the data to be recorded in storage. The list of cases within the original `Investigator` object remains untouched. The snippet of code below shows the implementation.

[source, java]
----
private CrimeCase syncWithMasterTagList(CrimeCase crimeCase) {
    // … logic for handling and rebuilding tags …

    return new CrimeCase(
        crimeCase.getCaseName(), crimeCase.getDescription(), crimeCase.getCurrentInvestigator(),,
        crimeCase.getStartDate(), crimeCase.getEndDate(), crimeCase.getStatus(), correctTagReferences);
}
----

Remember that each `Investigator` object has their own `UniqueCrimeCaseList` that holds `CrimeCase` objects that they've been assigned.

Since the `CrimeCase` object is replaced rather than modified, we need to remove the old `CrimeCase` object stored in the `UniqueCrimeCaseList` of the `Investigator` and reference the new, modified `CrimeCase` object instead. This is done by traversing the entire list of investigators and finding the correct `Investigator` object to remove the `CrimeCase` object from using the `removeCrimeCaseFromInvestigator` method. Next, after replacing the old `CrimeCase` object with the edited one in master list of all cases, it traverses the entire list of investigators again to add the case back to the correct `Investigator` object using the `addCrimeCaseFromInvestigator` method. The code below shows its implementation.

[source, java]
----
public void updateCrimeCase(CrimeCase target, CrimeCase editedCase)
throws DuplicateCrimeCaseException, CrimeCaseNotFoundException {
    requireNonNull(editedCase);

    CrimeCase syncedEditedCrimeCase = syncWithMasterTagList(editedCase);
    removeCrimeCaseFromInvestigator(target);
    cases.setCrimeCase(target, syncedEditedCrimeCase);
    addCrimeCaseToInvestigator(syncedEditedCrimeCase);
}
----

The following sequence diagram below illustrates how the Model component works when a case is edited.

.Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `editcase` Command
image::SD_EditCaseCommand_Model.png[width="600"]

//end::editcase[]

//tag::findcasesname[]
==== Find cases by name

===== Reason for implementation

To manage large numbers of cases, having a feature that would allow investigators to search the list of cases by name would be extremely helpful. If an investigator is looking for a particular case, it would be extremely inefficient and time-consuming to have to manually browse through all the cases. Hence, being able to find cases by name can help to increase workflow productivity and efficiency.

===== Current implementation

====== Logic component

The `FindCaseCommandParser` parses the string of arguments provided by the user to retrieve the list of keywords to be used in the context of the `DeleteCaseCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown if the user input does not conform to the expected format.

The `FindCaseCommand` has one constructor.


[width="100%", cols="1,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Constructor |Remark
|`new FindCaseCommand(predicate)` |Accepts a `CaseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as parameter.

The `targetIndex` is processed to retrieve the `CrimeCase` object at the specified index on the most recent list of cases displayed by the model.
|=======

The model is then updated to show the cases whose case name matches the predicate keywords. `EventsCenter` reacts to the `SwapTabEvent`, which switches the tab to show the filtered list of cases. The following snippet shows the execution code.

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult execute() {
    model.updateFilteredCrimeCaseList(predicate);
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwapTabEvent(1));
    return new CommandResult(getMessageForCrimeCaseListShownSummary(model.getFilteredCrimeCaseList().size()));
}
----

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `Logic` component operates when a keyword is given with the command.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `findcase magic` Command
image::SD_FindCaseCommand_Logic.png[width="800"]
//end::findcasesname[]

[[Find-Feature]]
//tag::findcasestag[]
==== Find cases by status/tags
The following sections provides an explanation on how the investigapptor finds
certain cases according to its status or tags.

===== Reason for implementation
This implementation improves efficiency as the investigators do not need to manually browse through
all the listed cases just to find certain cases.

By having a find command, the investigator can easily search for cases that they
are looking for. They can simply just run the find-related commands with their desired
keywords and the cases they require will be displayed instantly.

===== Current Implementation to find cases by status
Commands were created to find the cases according to the status specified. As there
are only two possible status - `open` or `close`, two separate command classes `FindCloseCaseCommand`
and `FindOpenCaseCommand` were created. These two commands inherits from its parent class - `FindByStatusCommand`.

====== Class Inheritance
[[CDFindByStatus]]
.Class Diagram to illustrate inheritance
image::CDFindByStatus.png[width="800"]

In both `FindCloseCaseCommand` and `FindOpenCaseCommand`, its respective constructor will
invoke its parent class' (`FindByStatusCommand`) constructor as passes in its corresponding status as the parameter.

`FindCloseCaseCommand` will pass in the status `close` as shown in the code segment below.
[source,java]
----
public FindCloseCaseCommand() {
    super(CASE_CLOSE);
}
----

`FindOpenCaseCommand` will pass in the status `open` as shown in the code segment below.
[source,java]
----
public FindOpenCaseCommand() {
    super(CASE_OPEN);
}
----
====== Sequence Diagrams for Logic Component
The following sequence diagrams represents the interactions within the `Logic`
component when the user inputs the `findopencases` or `findclosecases` command.

[[SDforFindOpenCase]]
.Sequence Diagram for interactions within Logic component for `FindOpenCaseCommand`
image::SDforFindOpenCase.png[width="800"]

[[SDforFindCloseCase]]
.Sequence Diagram for interactions within Logic component for `FindCloseCaseCommand`
image::SDForFindCloseCase.png[width="800"]

The `Logic` component will set the `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` with
a `List<String>` containing the keyword of either `open` or `close`.

For `FindCloseCaseCommand`, the `List<String>` will contain the keyword `close`;
whereas for `FindOpenCaseCommand`, the `List<String>` will contain the keyword `open`.

The command will be executed by the `LogicManager` by updating the
`FilteredCrimeCaseList` in the `Model` component with the given `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

====== Sequence Diagrams for Model Component
Below are the sequence diagrams that represents the interactions within the
`Model` component after the `findopencases` or `findclosecases` command
has been executed by the `LogicManager`.

[[SDForFindByStatusModel]]
.Sequence Diagram for interactions within Model component
image::SDForFindByStatusModel.png[width="800"]

The `Model` component is responsible for updating the filtered crime case list with
the given `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate`. The predicate will test if any keywords matches
with any status of the case(s).

Specifically, for `findopencases`, the predicate will test
if the keyword 'open' matches any cases with the status of 'open'. Similarly,
for `findclosecases`,  the predicate will test if the keyword 'close' matches
any cases with the status of 'close'.

The `FilteredCrimeCaseList` will then be updated with the cases that matches the
given `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

The `Model` will then raise a `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent` which is
captured by the `EventsCenter`. This event is used as an indication to update the calendar entries
whenever the `FilteredCrimeCaseList` has changed. This implementation can be found in
the <<Calendar-Events-Filter, above section>>.

====== Activity Diagram
The following activity diagram illustrates an example when a user executes a command that finds the cases
by its status.

[[ADForFindCase]]
.Activity Diagram when user enters `findclosecase` command
image::ADforFindCase.png[width="800"]

===== Current Implementation to find cases by tags
The command class, `FindCaseTagsCommand` was created to find the cases according to its tags. Cases whose tags
matches the keywords that the user has input will be displayed.

====== Sequence Diagrams for Logic Component
The following sequence diagrams represents the interactions within the `Logic`
component when the user inputs the `findcasetags`.

[[SDforFindCaseTags]]
.Sequence Diagram for interactions within Logic component
image::SDforFindCaseTags.png[width="800"]

The `Logic` component will set the `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` with
a `List<String>` containing the keywords that were parsed by `FindCaseTagsCommandParser`.

For the command `findcasetags fraud homicide` in the
<<SDforFindCaseTags, sequence diagram above>>, the `List<String>` will
contain the keywords `fraud` and `homicide`.

The command will be executed by the `LogicManager` by updating the
`FilteredCrimeCaseList` in the `Model` component with the given `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

====== Sequence Diagrams for Model Component
The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within the `Model` component.

[[SDforFindCaseTagsModel]]
.Sequence Diagram for interactions within Model component
image::SDForFindByStatusModel.png[width="800"]

The `Model` component is responsible for updating the filtered crime case list with
the given `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`. The predicate will test if any keywords matches
with any tags of the case(s).

For the example in the <<SDforFindCaseTags, above logic sequence diagram>>,
the predicate will test if the keywords "fraud" or "homicide" matches any cases'
tags.

The `FilteredCrimeCaseList` will then be updated with the cases whose
tags matches the keyword of either "fraud" or "homicide".

The `Model` will then raise a `FilteredCrimeCaseListChangedEvent` which is
captured by the `EventsCenter`. This event is used as an indication to update the calendar entries
whenever the `FilteredCrimeCaseList` has changed. This implementation can be found in
the <<Calendar-Events-Filter, above section>>.

===== Alternatives Considered
This section compares between the current choice of implementation and the
alternative choice that was considered. It lists the pros and cons to each of the
choices that were considered.

====== Aspect: Design Implementation
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Separate the find-related commands classes into its
individual category its searching for. In this case we have `FindCaseTagsCommand`,
`FindCloseCaseCommand` & `FindOpenCaseCommand`
** Pros: Easy for the user as they just need to know the command name/alias
(i.e. `findopencases` or `foc` will just instantly display the cases that are closed)
** Cons: Additional `.java` class files

* **Alternative 2 **: Have just one `FindCommand` class and use prefixes to differentiate
the type of keywords (i.e. findcase t/Tags s/Status)
** Pros: Only one `.java` file required for different types of find. Easier to
extend the command to find other details by adding more prefixes.
** Cons: Not as user-friendly. Users has to recognize the prefixes, could be
too technical for non-technical users.

====== Aspect: Class Implementation [for finding cases by status]
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Have two classes `FindCloseCaseCommand` and `FindOpenCaseCommand`
that are extended from parent class `FindByStatusCommand`
** Pros: No code duplication as duplicated set of codes will be in the parent class `FindByStatusCommand`
** Cons: Additional `.java` class file

* **Alternative 2 **: Separate commands into two classes without inheritance
** Pros: One less `.java` class file (no parent class)
** Cons: Duplicated set of codes
//end::findcasestag[]

[[case-select]]
//tag::selectcase[]
==== Select case

===== Reason for implementation

An investigator should be able to retrieve and view information about a case after adding them into the application.

===== Current implementation

====== Logic component

Similar to `DeleteCaseCommandParser`, the `SelectCaseCommandParser` parses the string of arguments provided by the user to retrieve the index (i.e. `Index`) to be used in the context of the `SelectCaseCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown if the user input does not conform to the expected format.

The `SelectCaseCommand` extends `Command` and has one constructor.

[width="100%", cols="1,2", options="header"]
|=======
|Constructor |Remark
|`new SelectCaseCommand(targetIndex)` |Accepts an `Index` object as parameter.
|=======

The `targetIndex` is processed to retrieve the `CrimeCase` object at the specified index on the most recent list of cases displayed by the model. Subsequently, a `JumpToCrimeCaseListRequestEvent` is posted to `EventsCenter` to signal the `UI` component. The following snippet shows the execution code.

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

    List < CrimeCase > lastShownList = model.getFilteredCrimeCaseList();

    if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_CASE_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }

    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new JumpToCrimeCaseListRequestEvent(targetIndex));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SELECT_CASE_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));

}
----

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens in the `Logic` component when a case is selected.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `selectcase 1` Command
image::SD_SelectCaseCommand_Logic.png[width="800"]

====== EventsCenter and UI component

Following the raised event, `handleJumpToCrimeCaseListRequestEvent` (in `CrimeCaseListPanel.java`) is signalled to handle the select request, which scrolls the view to the correct cell in the panel.

[source, java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleJumpToCrimeCaseListRequestEvent(JumpToCrimeCaseListRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    scrollTo(event.targetIndex);
}
----

Next, a `CrimeCasePanelSelectionChangedEvent` that contains the `CrimeCase` object that was selected, is raised. This event is handled by `handleCrimeCasePanelSelectionChangedEvent` (in `BrowserPanel.java`), as shown in the snippet below.

[source, java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleCrimeCasePanelSelectionChangedEvent(CrimeCasePanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadCrimeCasePage(event.getNewSelection().crimeCase);
}
----

The following sequence diagram below shows how the EventsCenter interacts with the UI component.

.Interactions Inside the EventsCenter and UI Component for the `selectcase 1` Command
image::SD_SelectCaseCommand_EventsCenter.png[width="600"]

`loadCrimeCasePage` method then takes the `CrimeCase` object contained within the event and splits it up into its various components (i.e. case name, description, investigator, start date, end date, status, and tags), to be processed for viewing on the UI.

To learn more about how the data is reflected onto the UI, you can take a look at <<UI-DetailsPane>>.

//end::selectcase[]

//tag::ui-enhancements[]
=== UI Enhancements

[[UI-DetailsPane]]
==== Details panel

This component is used by the `selectinvestigator` and `selectcase`(<<case-select>>) commands. The details pane makes use of JavaFx's `WebView` (an embedded browser) to render the data onto the display. The implementation for this can be found in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/ui/BrowserPanel.java[BrowserPanel].

Two HTML files, `/docs/InvestigatorDetailsPage.html` and `/docs/CaseDetailsPage.html` are created as templates for displaying the details of a single investigator and case respectively. `WebView` provides utility methods that can be used to load and display the HTML files.

A `String` containing the URL or file path is passed to the `load` method with a query string appended to the back (e.g. “https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/DummySearchPage.html?name=John%20Doe”). This method can be used to load pages from third-party services (e.g. Google Search).

[source, java]
----
public void loadPage(String url) {
    Platform.runLater(() - > browser.getEngine().load(url));
}
----

===== Example: Displaying case information

The following sub-section shows how the query string is generated for the `CrimeCase` object.

A URL query string is generated by deconstructing the `CrimeCase` object into its components (i.e. case name, description, investigator, start date, end date, status, and tags) as `String`. Components that might contain symbols such as “#” are encoded first before appending to the query string to prevent parsing error by the browser.

[source, java]
----
encDescription = URLEncoder.encode(description, "UTF-8");
encInvEmail = URLEncoder.encode(currentInvestigator.getEmail().value, "UTF-8");
encInvAddress = URLEncoder.encode(currentInvestigator.getAddress().value, "UTF-8");
encStartDate = URLEncoder.encode(startDate, "UTF-8");
encEndDate = URLEncoder.encode(endDate, "UTF-8")
----

[source, java]
----
String caseDetailsPage = CASE_DETAILS_PAGE +
    "?caseName=" + caseName +
    "&description=" + encDescription +
    "&tags=" + tagList +
    "&invName=" + currentInvestigator.getName().fullName +
    "&invRank=" + currentInvestigator.getRank().toString() +
    "&invPhone=" + currentInvestigator.getPhone().value +
    "&invEmail=" + encInvEmail +
    "&invAddress=" + encInvAddress +
    "&startDate=" + encStartDate +
    "&endDate=" + encEndDate +
    "&status=" + status;

loadPage(caseDetailsPage)
----

Javascript code is included in the HTML file to parse the URL request string and populate the HTML file with the corresponding case details.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation to view case details

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use HTML and Javascript with JavaFX `WebView` (embedded browser)
** Pros: Easy to implement and design with basic HTML knowledge.
** Cons: Passing of data to the HTML file has to be done with a request string, which can get a messy if the data is complex in structure. Loading data is not as efficient.
* **Alternative 2:** Use only JavaFX
** Pros: The view integrates more seamlessly with the application.
** Cons: More troublesome to implement and requires JavaFX knowledge.

**Reason for current choice:** As the data we have is simple, implementing and styling with HTML is easier.

==== Modify interface theme/colour scheme

It's easy to customize the look and feel of Investigapptor just by using CSS!

The default style of the interface is generated by link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/LightTheme.css[LightTheme.css]. To start personalising it, you can create a new CSS file in the `/resources/view/` directory and replace the name of the file in the following line in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[MainWindow.fxml]  with the name of your CSS file:

-----
<URL value="@LightTheme.css" />
-----

[TIP]
You can take a look at link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[DarkTheme.css] for reference on what elements you can change.

[NOTE]
The current version of Investigapptor does not provide users with the ability to set the theme from within the application. This is a feature that we wish to implement in future versions.

//end::ui-enhancements[]

== Documentation

We use link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.investigapptor.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.investigapptor.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.investigapptor.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.investigapptor.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/investigapptor/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
