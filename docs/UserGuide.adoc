== Introduction

CelebManager is a computer software designed to help celebrity managers *to manage their celebrities' schedules*.
It is *optimized for managers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the
feature of *managing persons, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right
place as CelebManager would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Follow this series of steps to have CelebManager quickly up and running on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer. The link to the latest version of Java
can be found
https://java.com/en/download/[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `CelebManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CelebManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The interface should appear in a few seconds.
+
The image below (Figure 1) shows the interface of CelebManager after the first launch.
+
.Interface of CelebManager upon the first launch
image::Ui_UserGuide.jpg[width="790"]
+
CelebManager's interface comprises of 5 panels: `CommandBox` (top), `ResultDisplay` (right below `CommandBox`),
`PersonListPanel` (left), `MapPanel` (bottom left), and `CalendarPanel` (bottom right), as labelled in the figure below.
Note that the labelling is for illustration purpose and will not appear in the actual interface.
+

image::Ui_labelled_UserGuide.jpg[width="790"]
+
`CommandBox` is for you to enter the commands. +
`ResultsDisplay` shows the execution result of the command entered in `CommandBox`. +
`PersonListPanel` displays the details of each person stored in CelebManager. There are some persons created to
provide you a quick view of how each person looks like in `PersonListPanel`. You can follow this guide to clear these
persons in the later part. +
`MapPanel` provides you a map view. +
`CalendarPanel` provides you a calendar view of the appointments stored in CelebManager. +
These panel names will be used to help explain the functionality of different commands.
+
.  Type `help` in `CommandBox` and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. A help window should be opened.
+
[TIP]
Refer to <<Features>> for details of all commands available in CelebManager and their example usage.

[[Features]]
== Features

For each of the command in CelebManager, their formats follow some general patterns as mentioned in the text box below.

====
*Command Format*

* All commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command, e.g. to add a contact to CelebManager,
you can type either `add n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi` or `a n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you, e.g. in `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`,
`NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `ADDRESS`, and `TAG` are parameters which can be used as
`add n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi`.
* Items in square brackets are optional, e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order, e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
acceptable.
====

====
*Precaution*

* Refrain from clicking inside the calendar at all times, except for scrolling up and down using the scroll bar.
This bug will be fixed in v2.0.
* Commands that modify the persons and appointments stored in CelebManager (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `undo`, `redo`,
`addAppointment`, `deleteAppointment`, `editAppointment` etc) must be performed in combined calendar view unless
specified otherwise. +
Information about combined calendar view can be found in +
<<Changing to view the combined calendar: `viewCombinedCalendar` [Since v1.3]>>.
====

In this section, screenshots of CelebManager are provided for your reference. The screenshots assume that CelebManager
is launched for the first time and commands are executed in the same format as the example usage, and in the same order
as they are listed here. +

The following are all the commands available to you:

=== General Features

General features include commands that affect and are affected by the overall status of CelebManager.

==== Viewing help : `help` [Since v1.0]

Alias: `c` +
Format: `clear` +
The picture below shows how CelebManager looks like after executing `clear`. +

.Status of CelebManager after executing `clear`
image::Ui_clean_state.jpg[width="790"]

a different date as it should show the current date.

==== Listing entered commands : `history` [Since v1.0]

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order in `ResultDisplay`. +
Alias: `h` +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====

Format: `exit`

==== Saving the data [Since v1.0]

CelebManager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

{sp} +

=== Address Book Features

Address book features allow you to modify and interact with the person list displayed in `PersonListPanel` located at
the middle left of CelebManager.

==== Person vs Celebrity: What's the difference?

In our application, Celebrities are meant to be the celebrities that you, the manager, are currently managing. The other people are each referred to as a Person. The way you create or edit a Person is almost exactly the same as a Celebrity. Both have the same necessary and optional fields to them such as a name, phone number, address, email and some descriptive tags. The only difference is that if you want to create a Celebrity instead of a regular Person in our app, you need to have a compulsory `celebrity` tag, in small letters. This will signal to the program that you want to create a Celebrity instead of a normal Person. In other words, the usage of `celebrity` as a tag is reserved for creation of Celebrities. In some of the commands which deal with the adding and editing of a person this will be further explained. In addition, if we use the term "Point of Contact" from here on out, it refers to a regular person without a `celebrity` tag (i.e. not a Celebrity).

Each celebrity has their own calendar, which will displays the appointments he/she will be attending.

==== Adding a person: `add` [Since v1.0]

Adds a person to CelebManager. +
Alias: `a` +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags, including 0.

****
* You can add two types of persons to CelebManager: contacts and celebrities.
* Celebrities refer to the celebrities that you, the manager, are currently managing, while contacts refer to other persons.
* Contacts refer to contacts other than celebrities.
* If you want to add a celebrity to CelebManager, you need to tag him/her with `celebrity` tag.
Refer to examples below for more information.
* For each celebrity added, CelebManager creates a calendar in `CalendarPanel` for him/her. This calendar displays the appointments
he/she will be attending.
* CelebManager assumes that any celebrity added is a celebrity that you are managing. If you want to add an actual celebrity
who is not managed by you, you need to avoid using `celebrity` tag and find another tag name to indicate this information.
****

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` +
Adds a contact named `John Doe` to CelebManager.

==== Displaying a specific date's calendar: `viewDate` [Since v1.5]

Changes the base date of calendar and displays the calendar by day for the specified `date`.
The base date is different from the current date. It is a date which `viewCalendarBy` is based on. Refer to the tip
below examples for more information. +
Alias: `vd` +
Format: `viewDate [DATE]`

****
* Changes base date to the specified `date`.
* When no date is given, it takes on the value of current date.
* `DATE` *must be in the format of* `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`. For the latter, year will be set to current year.
* `DATE` *must be* a valid date, eg, `01-13-2018` and `30-02` are not valid dates.
* This command can take slightly longer to load than other view-related commands.
****

Examples:

* `viewDate 03-05-2018` +
Changes the base date of calendar to `03-05-2018` and displays the calendar by day for `03-05-2018` as shown below.

* `viewDate` +
Changes the base date of calendar to current date and displays the calendar by day for current date. +

[TIP]
====
Change in base date allows you to view calendar for different weeks and months.
For example, after `viewDate 03-05-2018`, you can type `viewCalendarBy week` - which will show you the
calendar for the first week of May of 2018, or `viewCalendarBy month` - which will show you the calendar
for May of 2018.
