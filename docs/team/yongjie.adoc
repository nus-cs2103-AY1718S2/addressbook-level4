== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Revamped user interface and enhanced user experience (UI/UX).
** What was done for UI:
*** Changed to a green colour scheme as it signifies growth, and studies have shown that green improves efficiency and focus.
*** Implemented a 3-panel layout to display more information to the user.
** What was done for UX:
*** Added an autocompletion engine to help users enter commands quickly.
*** Enabled autosaving of theme preferences to maintain a hassle-free experience.
** Justification: This major enhancement directly shapes the user's overall experience of the product. An intuitive interface also reduces the learning curve of the features implemented by other team members.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to change themes in Flashy to further improve the customisability of the application.
