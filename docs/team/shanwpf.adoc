== PROJECT: Part-Time Manager (PTMan)

== Overview

PTMan is a desktop human resource application used for managing part-time employees. +

PTMan aims to give part-time employees the freedom of choosing when they want to work by registering for the available shifts set by the manager.
Thereby reducing the hassle of work scheduling for both employers and employees. +

The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *shift* feature.
** What it does: Allows employers to create work shifts. Employees can then apply for the shifts that they want to work in.
** Justification: This feature allows for easy management of manpower while giving employees the freedom and flexibility to work whenever they want to.
** Highlights: This enhancement modifies the app's model to store shifts.
The storage component also had to be modified to save shifts to local storage.
There were design considerations to integrate shifts into the existing model while minimizing coupling with the other components.
To enable user interaction with this feature, various commands that manipulate shifts had to be implemented.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added command aliases that are shorthands for the full commands.
