== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Enhanced flashcards to be *polymorphic*.
** What it does: Allows users to add and edit MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks flashcards (on top of normal ones).
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users learn differently (some need prompts) and the ability to add different kinds of flashcards would allow them to add those that suit their learning style.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, and care has to be taken so as to not affect the existing features.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a delete flashcard feature so that flashcards can be deleted when users no longer have a use for them.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/shawnclq.md[Functional Code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/shawnclq.md[Test Code]]
