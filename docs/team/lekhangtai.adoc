== PROJECT: Catalogue

---

== Overview

* This is a desktop Catalogue application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for librarians, students and guests using the library.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to borrow and return a book, using `borrow` and `return` commands respectively.
** What it does: Allows the librarian to be able to change the availability status of the book when a student borrows/returns it. Only books that are available can be borrowed, and books that are borrowed or reserved can be returned.
** Justification: This feature is of fundamental importance to this application. The Catalogue App  main purpose is to serve as a library application for the borrowing and returning of books for students. By implementing the borrow and return functions, the librarian will be able to keep track of the books availability.
** Highlights:This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it involves addition of new commands to the existing application.
** Credits: NIL

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to reserve a book, using `reserve` command.
** What it does: Allows the librarian to be able to change the availability  status of the book to 'Reserved' when a student decides to reserve a book. Only borrowed book can be reserved.
** Justification: This feature is of secondary importance as compared to `borrow` and `return` command, as reserving a book should be a additional feature that the library provides, up to the discretion of the librarian.
** Highlights:This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it involves addition of new command to the existing application.
