By: `Huat Ah Finance Pte Ltd`      Since: `Feb 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

If you:

* are a 21st Century modern loan shark boss,
* prefer to use a desktop app for managing operations,
* prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
* can type fast and prefer a keyboard as your main input method,

HuatAh! can get your operations management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Read on!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `HuatAh.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui-start.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type your selected command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  If you would like more detailed information about the commands, you may take a look at the <<Command Summary, Command Summary>>.
Keyboard shortcuts and aliases are also available for you to speed up your workflow!
.  Some example commands you can try:

== Command Summary
[NOTE]
====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n: NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n: John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n: NAME [t: TAG]` can be used as `n: John Doe t: friend` or as `n: John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t: TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t: friend`, `t: friend t: family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n: NAME p: PHONE_NUMBER`, `p: PHONE_NUMBER n: NAME` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

[qanda]
How do I transfer my data to another Computer?::
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Address Book folder. By default, the path for the data file is "data/addressbook.xml".

How do I save my data?::
The state of the database is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
Therefore, there is no need to save manually.

How can I report a bug or suggest improvements to this application?::
Open an issue https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F12-B4/main/issues[here]! We would love to hear your feedback! :)

What if I am not a loan shark boss yet?::
Work hard and collect more protection money! Maybe one day you'll make it! ;)

What if I am a law enforcement officer?::
Huat Ah Finance Pte Ltd takes no responsibility for the actions of its users.
We just like to make software that makes a positive impact on the world! :)

*On a serious note, this is just a student project with a humourous stance.*
