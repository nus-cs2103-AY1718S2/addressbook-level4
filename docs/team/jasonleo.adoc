== PROJECT: Fastis - MeetUp Manager

---

== Overview

Fastis is a desktop application that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively. The application enables students to keep track of group membersâ€™ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos and schedule suitable meetup time.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *group* feature
** What it does: It allows users to create a group class, which allows users to add members to the group, delete members from the group abd list them out and delete the group.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of members of a certain group project , which allows him to find the person of contact quickly and more easily. It also helps users to better manage members of his group project.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds many new commands to make the application more convenient for the users to organise their groups. It required an in-depth analysis of model and logic component. The implementation too was challenging as it required adding new commands and required understanding of the model to implement the group features.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added command to list members of the same tags. Also added colours to the tags.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/tree/master/collated/functional/jas5469.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/jas5469.md[Test code]]

// tag::listTagMembers[]
=== List Tag Members feature

Fastis lists all persons in Fastis that have tags similar to input.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses `ListTagMembersCommand`, which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
tag. <<fig25, Figure 25>> shows the sequence diagram of the `listTagMembers` command
[[fig25]]
.Sequence diagram of `listTagMembers` command.
image::listTagMemberSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

When user types in command line `listTagMembers` or `lTM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
tag and list out all members with the same  tag.

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command `listTagMembersCommand()` to list out the members with same tag.
** Pros: This implementation makes it is easy to change the methods called by command.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Change existing find command to include finding person with same tags.
** Pros: This implementation can reduce number of commands required to be remembered.
** Cons: This implementation can affect the functionality of existing commands.

// end::listTagMembers[]

// tag::addGroup[]
[[Group]]
=== Add Group feature

Fastis has a group feature that can:

* add a group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a group with information that was stated  by user input.
* add a person into the group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a person from the group with information that was stated by user input.
* list all the members in the group with information that was stated by user input.


==== Current implementation

The group mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueGroupList`, which resides inside `Model` component. Address book stores all groups in `UniqueGroupList`.
The groups in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `Information` object, representing the information of the group.
`Group`,`Information` and `UniqueGroupList` class reside inside `Model` component. <<fig26, Figure 26>>  is the class diagram showing the relationship between `Group`, `Information` and `UniqueGroupList`:

[[fig26]]
.Group Class Diagram.
image::GroupClassDiagram.png[width ="800"]

<<fig27, Figure 27>>  is a object diagram of Group Class.

[[fig27]]
.Object Diagram of `Group`.
image::GroupObjectDiagram.png[width="600"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application . The `UniqueGroupList` in the address book will include few groups that are declared in SampleDataUtil.

A Group consists of the following:

* Information: Represents the information of the group.
* PersonList: Represents the list of persons in a group.

The add group feature adds a group with information named by user in input into Fastis.


The add group mechanism is facilitated by `AddGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding `Group` object to the address book. `AddGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, `AddGroupCommand` can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the `AddGroupCommand` that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

<<fig28, Figure 28>> shows the interaction of `AddGroup` Command class.

[[fig28]]
.Class Diagram of add group Command.
image::AddGroupCommandClassDiagram.png[width:"600"]

The user executes a new `AddGroupCommand` with `Information`, to add a new group to the address book.
The new group is added to the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.

The `AddGroupCommand` is facilitated by `AddGroupCommandParser` to parse `AddGroupCommand`.
<<fig29, Figure 29>>  shows the flow of parsing of `AddGroupCommand` object.

<<fig30, Figure 30>> diagram shows how the add group operation works:

[[fig30]]
.AddGroup Sequence Diagram.
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeAddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation preserves `addGroup` functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `AddGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeAddGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Add Member To Group feature

Fastis adds a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The add member to group mechanism is facilitated by `AddMemberToGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports adding a member to `Group` objects to the address book. `AddMemberToGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddMemberToGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddMemberToGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddMemberToGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage as shown in  the following sequence diagram where  the storage saves to file in XmlAdaptedGroups.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

<<fig31, Figure 31>> shows the interaction of `AddMemberToGroup` Command class.

[[fig31]]
.Class Diagram of AddMemberToGroup Command.
image::aGMCommandClassDiagram.png[width:"600"]

The `AddMemberToGroupCommand` is facilitated by `AddMemberToGroupCommandParser` to parse `AddMemberToGroupCommand`.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddMemberToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddMemberToGroupCommand()`.
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()` to handle adding members to group.
** Pros: This implementation does not require a new command to be created.
** Cons: This implementation is less flexible.

=== Delete Member From Group feature

Fastis deletes a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The delete member from groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports deleting a member to Group objects to the address book. `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteMemberFromGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage.
The `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` will retrieve the input, which is the index of the person of the last updated person list, and deletes that person from the list if the person exists in the `UniquePersonList` in the specified group.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

<<fig34, Figure 34>>  shows the interaction of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command class.
[[fig34]]
.Class Diagram of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command.

* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()`.
** Pros: This implementation does not require a new command to be created.
** Cons: This implementation is less flexible.

=== List Group Members Feature

Fastis lists all persons under the group keyed by user.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses `ListGroupMembersCommand` ,which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
group.

When user types in command line `listGroupMembers` or `lGM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
group and list out all members under the specified group in the `PersonListPanel`.

The `ListGroupMembersCommand` is facilitated by `ListGroupMembersCommandParser` to parse `ListGroupMembersCommand`.
<<fig37, Figure 37>> shows the flow of parsing of `ListGroupMembersCommand` object.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `ListGroupMembersCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a command to list out the members with same group.
** Pros: This implementation makes the methods called by command easily modifiable.
** Cons: This implementation requires users and developers to remember more commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `ListGroupMembersCommand()`
** Pros: This implementation makes it easy to edit `ListGroupMembersCommand()` easily to suit our needs
** Cons: This implementation makes it hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Delete Group feature

Fastis deletes a group named by the user from input.

==== Current implementation

The delete groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting Group objects to the address book. DeleteGroupCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the DeleteGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The user executes a new `DeleteGroupCommand` with `Information`, to delete a existing group with the same information to the address book.
The group is deleted from the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.
