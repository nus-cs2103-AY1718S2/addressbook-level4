== PROJECT: VetterAppointments

== Overview

VetterAppointments is a desktop application catered to vets to manage their employees, clients, pets and appointments.
The vet interacts with the application mostly by a command line interface (CLI).
The application, written in Java, has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

This application was created by building upon an existing code base for an address book for the module CS2103T Software Engineering, and has around 20kLoC.

The purpose of this portfolio page is to demonstrate my software engineering experience and documentation skills gained from the above mentioned project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `listall` command
** What it does: The application will display all relevant details of the client that is queried, such as his/her pets and appointments, in a sidebar display
** Justification: When dealing with a client, vets often require a quick overview of the client, so that the vet can easily check the client's pets and upcoming appointments
** Highlights: This command requires iterations through multiple lists, one time to find all pets that belong to the queried client, and another time to search for all appointments that belong to each pet.
This command will update a separate sidebar display, instead of the individual lists. Hence much effort was also required to create the layout on the UI

* *Minor enhancement*: Modified `list` command and created UI for list tabs and appointment display
