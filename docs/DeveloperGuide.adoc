== Introduction

Welcome to VetterAppointments Developer Guide! VetterAppointments is a Java based application that helps manage the clients, employees and appointments of a vet. The application consists of many different components and feature implementations that work together to make VetterAppointments. +

This guide will serve to aid a you to understand the architecture and underlying interface of the application. +

If you are a new developer, you can follow the instructions in this guide to set up the program and start building upon it. +


== Setting Up

This section will guide you through the setting up of the development environment that you will require to start developing VetterAppointments.

=== Prerequisites

The following is what you need in order to begin working on the codebase for VetterAppointments:

* *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project on your computer

Follow the steps below to set up the VetterAppointments project in your computer:

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the correct JDK version
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it and click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`) +
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message and generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

To verify that the project has been set up properly:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass

=== Configurations to do before writing code

There are certain configurations that you need to set up before you are able to start writing code. You can follow the guide in this section to set up the configurations.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. +

Follow these steps to rectify the issue:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repository, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B4/main` repository.
If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103JAN2018-F09-B4/main`), you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).


== Design

This section will walk you through the design aspect of VetterAppointments. It will explain the application architecture and the different components that make up the application.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The software architecture of VetterAppointments consists of several key components that make VetterAppointments. It shows the overall organization of the system and how the underlying components interact with each other.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below in figure 3-1 explains the high-level design of the application.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600", caption="Figure 3-1. "]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At application launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other
* At application shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. These classes can be found in the seedu.addressbook.commons package.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter`: This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter`: This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to the application's log file

The rest of the application consists of the following four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Handles the user interface of the application
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk

Note that each of the four components:

* Define its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component
* Expose its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 3-2 given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Logic Component Class Diagram
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-2. "]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The architecture design of VetterAppointments is based on an event-driven architectural style. The events-driven nature of the design allows for the communication of several components of the application.

Figure 3-3 shows a _Sequence Diagram_ of how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Sequence Diagram of Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-3. "]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the application's data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below (Figure 3-4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Sequence Diagram of Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-4. "]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The following four sections in this guide will give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component controls the interactions that the user have with the VetterAppointments. It consists of several underlying components that make up the what the user sees on the UI.

The diagram below (Figure 3-5) represents the structure of the `UI` component in VetterAppointments.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-5. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As seen in figure 3-5, `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`,
`PetListPanel`, `VetTechnicianListPanel`, `ApptListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that can be found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the UI accordingly

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The logic component makes up the main logic of the VetterAppointments. It consists of the main bulk of logic code that allows the application to function as its intended purpose.

The diagram below (Figure 3-6) represents the structure of the `Logic` component in VetterAppointments.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-6. "]

Figure 3-7 shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3-6.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-7. "]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

`Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 3-8 shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Sequence Diagram of Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-8. "]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The model component allows for the management of data in VetterAppointments. It controls the flow of the data and how the data is contained within the application.

The diagram below (Figure 3-9) represents the structure of the `Model` component in VetterAppointments.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-9. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

`Model` represents the in-memory model of VetterAppointments data. All the data is managed by the `ModelManager` which can modify the data in the `AddressBook`. All the data are stored in `ObservableList<...>` within the `AddressBook`, any data modification will update the respective objects `ObservableList<...>`.

The `Model` component:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the application's data
* Exposes several unmodifiable `ObservableList<...>` for each object that can be 'observed' so that the UI can bound to this list and automatically update the UI when the data in the list changes
* Does not depend on any of the other three components

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The storage component controls the storage of data in VetterAppointments. It enable the application to safely read and write data on the user's computer.

The diagram below (Figure 3-10) represents the structure of the `Storage` component in VetterAppointments.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-10. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

`Storage` reads and write data from and to the computer local storage. The `StorageManager` handles the storage of the data in local storage. On application start, the `Storage` component will load the data from local storage into the application. Whenever the data is modified, `StorageManager` will then write the changes to the local storage.

The `Storage` component:

* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back
* Saves the application's data in xml format and read it back

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of VetterAppointments (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. Figure 4-1 shows the inheritance diagram for commands.

.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-1. "]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of VetterAppointments before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th client in VetterAppointments. The current state of VetterAppointments is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` as shown below in figure 4-2 (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Undo/Redo Initial Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-2. "]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person and the command will be pushed onto the `undoStack` as shown below in figure 4-3.

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-3. "]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

The program will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack` as shown below in figure 4-4. Next the program will restore the VetterAppointments to the state before the `add` command was executed.

.Undo/Redo Executed Undo Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-4. "]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

Figure 4-5 shows a sequence diagram of how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram of Undo/Redo operation
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-5. "]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores VetterAppointments to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command, as shown below in figure 4-6 (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (Clear)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-6. "]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution, as shown below in figure 4-7.

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (List)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-7. "]

Figure 4-8 below shows the activity diagram that summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command.

.Undo/Redo Activity Digram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650", caption="Figure 4-8. "]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: It does not involve the template pattern, so it is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()` or they will lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save a copy of the entire data of VetterAppointments
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: There may be performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify each individual command to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Less memory will be used (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies VetterAppointments (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost).
** Cons: The user might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands
** Pros: It might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: The user has no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of VetterAppointments and not the view.


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: It is easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: The logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: We are required to deal with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. This violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Pet component feature

==== Reasons for implementation

VetterAppointments is designed for vets to manage his team of vet technicians, clients and most importantly, the pets.
The Pet component feature stores the necessary Pet details like name, gender, age, tags as well as appointments.
Such details are essential to facilitate other functions such as viewing the client's appointments and the pet's appointments on the GUI.

==== Current implementation

*Model component* +
Currently the `Pet` object is initialized by calling it's constructor. The constructor
initializes the four fields of `Pet` to respective arguments supplied by the user. +

*Constructing a `Pet` object*
[source,java]
----
public Pet(PetName petName, PetAge petAge, PetGender petGender, Set<Tag> tags) {
    requireAllNonNull(petName, petAge, petGender, tags);
    this.petName = petName;
    this.petAge = petAge;
    this.petGender = petGender;
    this.tags = tags;
}
----
Explanation for arguments: +

`PetName`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pn/`. It stores the details of the pet name
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetName` validates the name of the pet supplied. Only alphanumeric characters are allowed. +

The constraints for a valid pet name is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String PETNAME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[\\p{Alnum}][\\p{Alnum} ]*";
----

`PetAge`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pa/`. It then stores the details of the pet age
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetAge` validates the age supplied by the user. Only 1-2 digit numbers are allowed. +

The constraints for a valid pet age is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String PET_VALIDATIONS_REGEX = "\\d{1,2}";
----

`Petgender`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pg/`. It stores the pet gender details
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetGender` validates for supplied gender. Only M or F is allowed, representing Male or Female.
It is case insensitive. +

The constraints for a valid pet gender is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String GENDER_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[m,f,M,F]";
----

`Set<Tag>`: In addition to the PetName, PetAge and PetGender, a `Set<Tag>` is also needed for the construction of a `Pet` object. +
[NOTE]
The tags for a pet is used to represent the species and breed for that particular pet. +

All the `Pet` objects that were created in the program will be stored in a class called `UniquePetList`.
The `UniquePetList` class ensures that no duplicates of the same pet are stored inside the program.

The figure below shows a simple overview of the `Pet` class. +

.Pet class diagram snippet
image::pet_diagram_snippet.png[width="780", caption="Figure 4-9. "]

*Logic component* +
The `Pet` object interacts with several commands in the program. +

. `addp`: Adds a `Pet` into a `Client` through a wrapper class called `ClientOwnPetAssociation` and into `UniquePetList`.
. `deletep`: Removes the `Pet` object from both the wrapper class and `UniquePetList`.
. `addappttopet`: Adds the `ClientOwnPetAssociation` wrapper into the `Appointment` class. +
To adhere to defensive programming practices, the `addappttopet` does the following:
.. Creates a copy of the specified `Appointment`.
.. Adds the `ClientOwnPet` to the copy
.. Replaces the original `Appointment` with the copy.
. `removeapptfrompet`: Removes the `ClientOwnPetAssociation` from the `Appointment`. +
To adhere to defensive programming practices the `removeapptfrom` does the following:
.. Creates a copy of the specified `Appointment`.
.. Removes the `ClientOwnPetAssociation` from the copy.
.. Replaces the original with the cop.
. `sortp`: Sorts the pet list.

The `addappttopet` command copies the `Appointment` object this way:

[source,java]
----
for (ClientOwnPet a : clientPetAssociations) {
            if (a.getPet().equals(pet)) {
                isPresent = true;
                if (appointment.getClientOwnPet() == null) {
                    Appointment appointmentCopy = new Appointment(appointment);
                    appointmentCopy.setClientOwnPet(a);
                    appointments.setAppointment(appointment, appointmentCopy);
                    isAdded = true;
                }
            }
}
----

The `removeapptfrompet` command copies the `Appointment` object in a similar way:

[source, java]
----
 public void removeAppointmentFromPet(Appointment appointment) throws
            AppointmentNotFoundException, DuplicateAppointmentException, AppointmentDoesNotHavePetException {
        if (!appointments.contains(appointment)) {
            throw new AppointmentNotFoundException();
        } else {
            Appointment appointmentCopy = new Appointment(appointment);

            if (appointmentCopy.getClientOwnPet() == null) {
                throw new AppointmentDoesNotHavePetException();
            } else {
                appointmentCopy.setClientOwnPetToNull();
                appointments.setAppointment(appointment, appointmentCopy);
            }
        }
 }
----


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of Appointment class,  Pet class & Client class
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Make a wrapper class that associates
a pet and a client together. With that association class, insert the object into
an appointment object. Have the appointment class that sets and gets the client
and pet association class.
** Pros: Reduces coupling and increases cohesion. The appointment class will now be
the overheading class that takes in the pet and client.
** Cons: Increases the code and program complexity. To amend the details of a client/pet
after insertion into an appointment will be inefficient.

* *Alternative 2:* Make the Pet class take in Appointment and Client object.
** Pros: Querying each component will be simplified and fast. Code will be easier to
understand while still respecting the OOP principle.
** Cons: Hugely increases coupling. There will be too many null objects or dependencies
on other class components.
// end::mdazharPet[]

// tag::listperson[]
=== List and display clients, pets and vet technicians

==== Current implementation

The side bar of the user interface implements a `TabPane` with three tabs,
'Client', 'Pet' and 'Vet Tech' where clicking on each tab will show the
corresponding list. We will use the pet list to demonstrate the implementation.

The 'Pet' `Tab` consists of a `StackPane` called `petListPanelPlaceholder` in the `MainWindow.fxml` file.

In the `MainWindow.java` file, the `petListPanel`
retrieves the updated list of pets from `logic`, and the `petListPanel` is added to `petListPanelPlaceholder` to be displayed this way:

[source, java]
----
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Stage> {
    void fillInnerParts() {
        petListPanel = new PetListPanel(logic.getFilteredPetList());
        petListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(petListPanel.getRoot());
        // ...other placeholders...
    }
}
----

The `PetListPanel` is a `ListView` which contains a list of `PetCard` which is implemented this way:

[source, java]
----
public class PetListPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    @FXML
    private ListView<PetCard> petListView;

    private void setConnections(ObservableList<Pet> petList) {
        ObservableList<PetCard> mappedList = EasyBind.map(
                petList, (pet) -> new PetCard(pet, petList.indexOf(pet) + 1));
        petListView.setItems(mappedList);
        petListView.setCellFactory(listView -> new PetListViewCell());
    }
}
----

The `PetCard` contains a single pet and sets the pet's details and the layout of the display of details.

Figure 4-10 below is a screenshot of the final displayed pet list, where each pet, for example 'Garfield',
is contained in a `PetCard`, and the cards of all pets are presented in a list form by using `PetListPanel`.

.Screenshot of a List of Pets
image::list_pet.PNG[width="350" caption="Figure 4-10. "]

Aside from toggling the lists by clicking on the tabs, the `list` command is implemented to take in a parameter
of either 'client', 'pet' or 'vettech' so that the list view updates appropriately when the `list` command is used.

Depending on the parameter, the `ListCommand` creates and adds `ChangeListTabEvent`
to `EventCenter`, which is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
        public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

            switch (targetType) {
            case "pet":
                model.updateFilteredPetList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PET);
                EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeListTabEvent(1));
                break;
                // ...other cases...
            }
            // ...return...
        }
}
----

The `MainWindow` then handles the `ChangeListTabEvent` by changing to the corresponding list on the UI display,
and updates `logic` with the index of the current list so that other commands like `edit` and `delete`
can perform the command on the correct list, which is implemented this way:

[source, java]
----
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Stage> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleChangeListTabEvent(ChangeListTabEvent event) {
        changeTo(event.targetList);
        logic.setCurrentList(event.targetList);
    }
    private void changeTo(int list) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> {
            listPanel.getSelectionModel().select(list);
        });
    }
}
----

With this implementation, whether changing list by mouse-click or by command,
the application always contains the index of the current list being viewed,
so that the correct list will be displayed, and so that all other commands will
be executed on the correct list.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of toggling between lists
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Client, Pet and Vet Tech lists are stored in three separate tabs,
and an event is handled to toggle between the tabs to display the corresponding list
** Pros: There are clickable tabs on the UI for easy toggling with both typing and mouse-click.
** Cons: The `MainWindow` needs to handle the event to switch to the correct tab.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a single display without tabs, and update it with either Client, Pet or Vet Tech list when the `list`
command is executed
** Pros: There is no need to create a new event and handle it.
** Cons: The displayed list needs to be updated every time `list` command is executed, reducing efficiency.

=== Schedule, unschedule and reschedule appointments feature
==== Reasons for implementation
These features support the main functionality of *VetterAppointments* which is to facilitate the process of scheduling and organizing appointments.

==== Current implementation
*Model component* +
To schedule an appointment, the Vet must create a meeting by specifying the date, time, duration and a brief description.

The diagram figure 4-11 below illustrates the overview of the appointment class. +

.Overview the Appointment Class in VetterAppointments
image::ModelAppointmentClassDiagram.png[width="780", caption="Figure 4-11. "]

As you can see from the class diagram figure 4-11, there are four attributes of an appointment, and an individual class implements each of them.

We are not using the java date and time class but implementing our self-defined data types. The reason is to check the invalidity more efficiently.

The diagrams figure 4-12 below shows the class diagram for date and time. +

.Date and Time Class Diagram Snippets
image::AppointmentClassDemo.png[width="500", caption="Figure 4-12. "]

The methods to check for a valid date are implemented these ways:

* check for format

[source,java]
----
 public static final String DATE_VALIDATION_REGEX =
            "([2-9][0-9][1-9][89])-(0?[1-9]|1[012])-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])";
----
By checking the date regex, the only the date entered in the format of YYYY-MM-DD will be accepted.

* check for valid years

[source,java]
----
private static final int YEAR_LOWER_BOUND = 2018;

public static boolean isValidYear(int test) {
        return test >= YEAR_LOWER_BOUND;
    }
----

[NOTE]
The year should be later than 2018.

* check for valid days

The code below shows all static values used to check for the validity of a given date.

[source,java]
----
private static final int BIG_MONTH_DAY = 31;
private static final int SMALL_MONTH_DAY = 30;
private static final int FEB_LEAP_YEAR_DAY = 29;
private static final int FEB_NONLEAP_YEAR_DAY = 28;
private  static final String[] BIG_MONTH = {"01", "03", "05", "07", "08", "10", "12"};
private  static final String[] SMALL_MONTH = {"04", "06", "09", "11"};
----

The code below shows the actual implementation of validating values for a given date.
[source,java]
----
public static Boolean isValidDaysInMonth(String test) {
        int testYear = getYear(test);
        String testMonth = getMonth(test);
        int testDay = getDay(test);
        int daysInMonth;

        if (Arrays.asList(BIG_MONTH).contains(testMonth)) {
            daysInMonth = BIG_MONTH_DAY;
        } else if (Arrays.asList(SMALL_MONTH).contains(testMonth)) {
            daysInMonth = SMALL_MONTH_DAY;
        } else {
            if (isLeapYear(testYear)) {
                daysInMonth = FEB_LEAP_YEAR_DAY;
            } else {
                daysInMonth = FEB_NONLEAP_YEAR_DAY;
            }
        }
        return testDay <= daysInMonth;
    }
----

By checking whether the given month is big, small or February, we can compare the day entered with the last day of the month. If the day provided is less than or equal to the last day in the month then the date entered by the user can be considered valid.

The code below shows how to determine a leap year:
[source,java]
----
private static final int LEAP_YEAR_DIVIDER = 4;
private static final int CENTURY_YEAR_DIVIDER = 100;
private static final int CENTURY_LEAP_YEAR_DIVIDER = 400;
private static final int LEAP_YEAR_REMAINDER = 0;

 public static boolean isLeapYear(int test) {
    if ((test % CENTURY_LEAP_YEAR_DIVIDER == LEAP_YEAR_REMAINDER)
        || ((test % LEAP_YEAR_DIVIDER == LEAP_YEAR_REMAINDER)
        && (test % CENTURY_YEAR_DIVIDER != LEAP_YEAR_REMAINDER))) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
 }
----


The method to check for a valid time is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
 public static final String TIME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9])";
----
By checking the time regex, only time entered in the format of HH:MM will be accepted.

[NOTE]
Time is expressed in 24 hour format hence hour ranges from 00 to 23 and minute from 01 to 60. +

The diagram figure 4-13 below shows the class diagram of duration. +

.Duration Class Diagram Snippet
image::AppointmentClassDemo2.png[width="500", caption="Figure 4-13. "]

The method to check for a valid duration is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
 public static final String DURATION_VALIDATION_REGEX = "(1[5-9]|[2-9][0-9]|1[01][0-9]|120)";
----

[NOTE]
Duration can be either two or three digit number and the value is in minute.

The diagram figure 4-14 below shows the class diagram of appointment. +

.Appointment Class Diagram Snippet
image::AppointmentClassDemo3.png[width="500", caption="Figure 4-14. "]

To differentiate appointments, I implement the equals method this way:

[source,java]
----
public boolean equals(Object other) {
    ......
    ......
    Appointment otherAppointment = (Appointment) other;
    return otherAppointment.getDate().equals(this.getDate())
           && otherAppointment.getTime().equals(this.getTime());
}
----

To avoid overlapping between any two appointments, I implement the following two checks:
* check for previous
* check for next

The code snippet below shows the check for previous.
[source,java]
----
public boolean hasPrevious(Appointment currentAppointment) {
    ......
    ......
    for (Appointment earlierAppointment : internalList) {
        ......
        if (newAppointmentDate.equals(earlierAppointmentDate)) {
                if (earlierAppointmentTime.getHour() < currentHour
                        || (earlierAppointmentTime.getHour() == currentHour
                        && earlierAppointmentTime.getMinute() < currentMin)) {

                    interval = currentAppointment.calDurationDifferencePositive(earlierAppointment);
                    if (interval < minInterval) {
                        minInterval = interval;
                        previous = earlierAppointment;
                        hasPreviousAppointment = true;
                    }
                    ....
----

check for next is similar and the code snippet below only shows different.
[source,java]
----
public boolean hasNext(Appointment currentAppointment) {
    ......
    ......
    if (laterAppointmentTime.getHour() > currentHour
                        || (laterAppointmentTime.getHour() == currentHour
                        && currentMin < laterAppointmentTime.getMinute())) {
                    interval = currentAppointment.calDurationDifferenceNegative(laterAppointment);
                    if (interval < minInterval) {
                        minInterval = interval;
                        next = laterAppointment;
                        hasNextAppointment = true;
                    }
                    ......
----

[NOTE]
Only date and time are responsible for duplicate appointments.

*Logic component* +
The following sequence diagram figure 4-15 shows how the schedule command works. +

.Sequence Diagram of Interactions inside the Logic Component for `schedule date time duration` Command
image::ScheduleLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-15. "]

As you can see from the above diagram, the schedule command first goes to the `logicManager` and then gets parsed by the `ScheduleCommandParser`.
After getting the appointment object from `Model`, the command result is returned to `LogicManager`.

*Storage component* +
The following diagram figure 4-16 shows how the appointment is being stored in VetterAppointments. +

.Appointment Storage Class Diagram
image::AppointmentStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-16. "]

As shown in the above diagram figure 4-16, appointments are saved and read back in XML format.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of appointment class
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Use aggregation association
** Pros:All objects such as date, time, duration and description can survive after deleting an appointment associate them. In other words, ending one entity will not affect the other. Aggregation also helps to reduce class coupling.
Aggregation also helps to reduce class coupling.
** Cons: The association is weak.
* ** Alternative 2: **Use composition association
** Pros:It ensures a strong one to one association between all parts.
** Cons: The composed objects cannot exist without the other entity.

==== Aspect: Implementation of date and time classes
* ** Alternative 1: **(current choice) Use self defined classes
** Pros: You have the full knowledge of the implementation of the methods and characteristic of attributes. As a result, you can customize the class to make it answer queries more efficiently.
** Cons: It is easier to make mistakes when implementing the methods.
* ** Alternative 2: ** Use java class library
** Pros: It is straightforward and easy to use. You only care about the functions rather than the implementation.
** Cons: The lack of the knowledge about implementation makes the debugging harder. Also, you may need to create extra methods to perform specific functions that are not defined in the class.

=== Client, vet technician, pet, appointment entity

==== Reasons for implementation

VetterAppointments requires to manage clients, vet technicians, pets and appointments in the application. An implementation of these objects is required for the application to be able to process the data.

==== Current implementation

The entities of VetterAppointments are contained within the `AddressBook` class. `AddressBook` maintains the collections of `Person`, `Appointment`, `ClientOwnPet` and `Pet`.

Figure 4-17 below shows the class diagram of how the entities are connected in VetterAppointments.

.Entity Relationship Class Diagram
image::DataObjectClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-17. "]

As seen from figure 4-17 VetTechnician` and `Client` are sub classes of the `Person` class. `ClientOwnPet` is an association class that associates the ownership of the `Pet` to the `Client`. `Appointment` will contain the `VetTechnician` and `ClientOwnPet` that will have the associated `Client` and `Pet`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of entity data model

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only couple entities if necessary
** Pros: Low coupling. Classes will have lesser dependency between entities.
** Cons: New developers will need to thoroughly understand the class interactions.
* **Alternative 2:** Couple all entities
** Pros: Classes can easily access highly coupled classes.
** Cons: High coupling. Integration and testing will be harder.
// end::entitymodel[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete feature

==== Reasons for implementation

The autocomplete feature will allow vets to type their commands quicker as some of the commands require several inputs from the vet. With the autocomplete feature, vets will be able to execute commands faster to save time.

==== Current implementation

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `AutoCompleteManager`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports the auto completion of incomplete commands by providing a list of auto completed command from a given incomplete command.

An underlying `Trie` data structure is used to facilitate the `AutoCompleteManager` functionality.
The `Trie` only supports the auto completion of commands provided by `AutoCompleteManager`. The `CommandParameterSyntaxHandler` which resides in `AutocompleteManager` supports the auto completion of parameters for commands.

Figure 4-18 shows the class diagram of the autocomplete implementation.

.Autocomplete Implementation Class Diagram
image::LogicAutoCompleteClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-18. "]

The `CommandBox` will interact with the AutoCompleteManager from using the `LogicManager`.
When the user presses tab in the command box area, the `CommandBox` will handle the tab key press and executes the `autoCompleteUserInput()` method.

[source,java]
----
public class CommandBox extends UiPart<Region> {

    private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
        switch (keyEvent.getCode()) {
        // ... other cases ...
        case TAB:
            keyEvent.consume();
            autoCompleteUserInput();
            break;
        default:
            // let JavaFx handle the keypress
        }
    }

    /* Shows auto completed text or suggestions on the UI */
    private void autoCompleteUserInput() {
        // ... auto complete logic ...

        if (isTabDoubleTap()) {
            // ... show suggestion on UI logic ...
        }
    }

}
----

The `isTabDoubleTap()` method will check if the user presses tab twice in quick succession. If true, the `CommandBox` will show a list of command suggestions for the current user input.

Figure 4-19 shows the sequence diagram of how the autocomplete operation works.

.Autocomplete Sequence Diagram
image::AutoCompleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-19. "]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of autocomplete capability

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a manager class to handle all autocomplete behaviour
** Pros: The class will allow for more code abstraction and can also be implemented elsewhere.
** Cons: New developers will need to thoroughly understand the class interactions.
* **Alternative 2:** Add the autocomplete logic simply in the `Commandbox`
** Pros: Other classes are not involved, making it easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: It breaks the Single Responsibility Principle.

===== Aspect: Implementation of algorithm

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a Trie data structure
** Pros: Software performance will be better.
** Cons: It is difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through all possible commands to find match prefix
** Pros: It is easier to implement.
** Cons: It may result in performance loss if there are too many commands.
// end::autocomplete[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>).

The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
Currently log messages are output through the `Console` and to a `.log` file.

These are the four logging levels:

* `SEVERE` : A critical problem has been detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : The user can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below

.Saving Documentation as PDF Files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300" caption="Figure 5-1. "]

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.

To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

To run all tests, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of Tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ that target the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that check the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working) +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests that check multiple code units as well as how they are connected together +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`]
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, VetterAppointments depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* Occupation as a vet
* Has a need to manage a significant number of clients, pets and appointments
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*:

Allow vets to easily manage their clients and schedule appointments

*Feature Contributions*:

*Jonathan Weng*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support auto-complete for all commands
+
[none]
** When the vet presses the 'Tab' button on the keyboard once while in the command box, the application
will auto-complete the text. Auto-complete support not only works on command words, but also when
searching for the names of existing clients, pets and vet technicians in the application. This will allow the vet
to partially type a command and quickly complete it to improve typing efficiency.
** When the vet presses the 'Tab' button on the keyboard twice in quick succession while in the command box,
the application will list down all possible text to be auto-completed to.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Support for adding clients and vet technicians to the application
+
[none]
** The `add` command now takes in a ROLE parameter (either 'Client' or 'VetTechnician')
so that the vet can add the new person to the correct list.
** The `delete` and `edit` command will also allow the vet to remove and edit clients and vet technicians.

// tag::mdazharEnhancements[]
*Md Azhar*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: A collection of commands that supports the Pet component and Appointment component.

. Pet class containing: PetName, PetAge, PetGender and Tag classes.
. AddPetCommand
. DeletePetCommand
. AddAppointmentToPetCommand
. RemoveAppointmentFromPetCommand
. SortAppointmentCommand
. SortClientCommand
. SortPetCommand
. UnscheduleCommand


[none]
** The Pet class component is the backbone of `addp`, `deletep`, `addappttopet`,
`removeapptfrompet`, `sortp` commands.
** The `addp` command adds a pet to a specified client based on the index provided by
the user. The `deletep` command is the converse of `addp`. It removes the pet from a
specified client.
** The `addapptopet` adds a specified appointment to a specified pet based on the index
provided. Likewise, `removeapptfrompet` is the converse of `addappttopet` command,
removing the specified appointment based on the appointment index from a pet.
** The `sortp` command sorts the existing pet objects in the XML file lexicographically.
** The `sortc` command sorts the existing client objects in the XML file lexicographically.
** The `sortappt` sorts the appointment objects in date then time. It automatically
sorts when scheduling a new appointment.
** The `unschedule` command removes a specified appointment object based on index.

All of the commands listed are Undoable and saved into the XML data file.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Implement aliases for command words +

[none]
** The aliases of command words will allow the vet to reduce the amount of typing
required for command words, to increase efficiency in using the application.

// end::mdazharEnhancements[]

*Choo Wen Xin*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support `listall` command and listing all appointments
+
[none]
** The UI will update and display all appointments in the main section of the application
listed in date order, and in time order within each (date) section. This is for the vet to
easily keep track of his/her appointments in chronological order.
** The `listall` command will take in an index parameter specifying a client, and will then display all the pets and appointments of
that particular client in a sidebar of the application. This is to easily see the relevant details when wanting to check a particular client.
The appropriate display on the UI will also be created.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Update `list`, `edit`, `delete` command and have display tabs for the lists
+
[none]
** The `list` command now takes in a parameter (either 'client', 'pet' or 'vettech')
and the `MainWindow` will handle the event created by the `list` command and toggle the tabs in the sidebar of the application and display the appropriate list
for easy viewing and keeping track. The tabs can be toggled by mouse-click as well.
** The `edit` and `delete` commands will be updated so that it only affect the index of the currently viewed list.

** The `schedule` command allows the vet to schedule an appointment of a specific date, time and duration attached with a brief description.
** The `reschedule` command to reschedule the appointment to another date, time or duration. This command is also able to edit the length and description.
** The `editappt` command allows the vet to update the details of an appointment,
such as the assigned vet technician and the data and time. Client and Pet can be
changed as well if necessary. The affected clients, pets and vet technicians should
be updated accordingly as well. (in the future version v2.0)
