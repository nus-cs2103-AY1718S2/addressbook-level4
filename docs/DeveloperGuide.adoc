== Introduction

=== About Codeducator

Codeducator is an open source Command Line Interface (CLI) address book and scheduling desktop application.
We aim to provide a solution for private programming tutors to better manage their student contacts, tutoring schedule and track their students' learning progress.

=== How to Contribute

There are lots of ways to contribute to Codeducator: coding, testing or improving our build process and tools. This developer's guide provides information that will help you get started as a Codeducator contributor. Even if you are an experienced Codeducator developer, you will still find this guide to be useful to refer to. +

If you are ready to contribute, simply create a Pull Request (PR) on our main repository.

If you have found any bugs or have ideas to improve Codeducator, create an issue https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B3/main/issues[here] or https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B3/main/blob/master/docs/ContactUs.adoc[contact us] directly.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites
To contribute to Codeducator, you will need the following software:

* *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
You can download the latest Java version https://java.com/en/download/[here].

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
+
You can download the latest Intellij IDE https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[here].


=== Setting up the project in your computer
To set up the project in your computer, follow the steps below:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup
You will need to verify if your environment is set up correctly before you can start working on Codeducator. +

In Intellij,

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
You will need to configure and set up some tools we use before you can start making meaningful contributions to Codeducator.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is also a quick overview of each component.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteStudent.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteStudentEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteStudentSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of the Dashboard Class. This diagram shows finer details about the Dashboard Class.
image::ModelComponentDashboardClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th student in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new student.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| Implementation of `UndoableCommand`
| *Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` (current choice)*
| + : We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
   {empty} +
 - : Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
| Just override `execute()`
| + : Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
  {empty} +
  - : Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

.2+| How undo & redo executes
| *Saves the entire address book. (current choice):*
| + : Easy to implement. +
 {empty} +
 - : May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
| Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
| + : Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted). +
 {empty} +
 - : We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

.2+| Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
{empty} +
Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

| *Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). (current choice):*
| + : We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost). +
 {empty} +
 - : User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
| Include all commands.
| + : Might be more intuitive for the user. +
 {empty} +
 - : User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.

.2+| Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
| *Use separate stack for undo and redo (current choice)*
| + : Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
  - : Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
| Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
| + : We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
 {empty} +
 - : Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
|=======================================================================
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

== Features Implementation

// tag::favourites[]
=== Favourites feature

The favourites feature allows users to remember/mark a student by adding them to favourites.

==== Current Implementation

To facilitate the favourite/unfavourite feature, an association with a new `Favourite` class is added to the `Student` class:

.Structure of the atrributes of a `Student` in the Model component. The diagram shows that the `Student` class is associated with the `Favourite` class.
image::StudentWithPLFeature.png[width="500"]

Since the implementation of the favourite and unfavourite command are similar, we will describe the implementation of the favourite command only.

The following sequence diagram shows how the favourite command works:

.Sequence diagram for the favourite command
image::FavouriteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The `FavouriteCommandParser` parses the user input to obtain the target student index and constructs a new `FavouriteCommand` with this index.
. The logic portion of the favourite command will be executed by the `FavouriteCommand` class.
To mark a `Student` object called "studentToFavourite" as favourite:
.. The `preprocessUndoableCommand()` method calls `setTargetStudent()` which will set the "studentToFavourite" object based on the provided student index.
.. `preprocessUndoableCommand()` will then call the `createEditedStudent()` method which will create a `Student` object called "editedStudent". "editedStudent" will have the attributes of "studentToFavourite", except that its `Favourite` attribute will be set to "true". +
`createEditedStudent()` is implemented as such:

[source, java]
----
    private void createEditedStudent() {
        assert targetStudent != null;
        editedStudent = new StudentBuilder(target).withFavourite(true).build();
    }
----
[start=3]
. In the `executeUndoableCommand()` method, `Model.updateStudent(Student, Student)` is called to replace "studentToFavourite" with "editedStudent" in the Address Book in-memory.

==== Design Considerations
[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| Implementation of 'FavouriteCommand'
| *Add a `Favourite` attribute to `Student` (current choice)*
| + : It is easy to mark a student as favourite since we can make use of the current `Model.updateStudent(Student, Student)` method by creating a copy of the target `Student` object, with the value of its `Favourite` attribute set to "true" +
{empty} +
  - : Creating a copy of the `Student` object can be inefficient
| Create a new `UniqueFavouriteStudentsList` that contains the list of students in favourites and store this list in the Address Book
| + : Students that are currently in favourites can be managed more easily since there is a direct overview of which student is in favourites +
{empty} +
 - : Students in the `UniqueFavouriteStudentsList` have to be synced with the `UniqueStudentsList`. For example, we have to ensure that deleting a student in the `UniqueStudentList` deletes the student in the `UniqueFavouriteStudentsList` too
|=======================================================================

// end::favourites[]

// tag::location[]
=== Location feature
Selecting a student using the `select` command will render their location on google maps.

==== Current Implementation

The address of the student is extracted and converted in a string to be appended to the end of the `SEARCH_PAGE_URL` in the following function

----
    private void loadStudentPage(Student student) {
        Address location = student.getAddress();
        String append = location.urlstyle();
        loadPage(SEARCH_PAGE_URL + append);
    }
----

An example is provided below when `select 1` is entered as a command:

image::location_ss.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| Implementation of displaying student locations
| *Display it on the embedded browser (current choice)*
| + : Easy to implement, simply alter the default webpage +
 {empty} +
 - : Might not be able to display student information and location simultaneously
| Creating a new window to display the location
| + : This would allow concurrent display of locations of many students +
{empty} +
  - : the UI would be messy and user has to navigate between 2 different windows
|=======================================================================
// end::location[]


=== Programming Language Feature

The `programmingLanguage` field is part of the student model and helps to keep track of what programming language he/she is being taught with.

==== Current Implementation

The programming language feature involves having an additional class to the student model called `ProgrammingLanguage`.
It stores the name of the programming language currently being taught to each student as a string.

[NOTE]
The string for `ProgrammingLanguage` must contain visible characters.

image::StudentWithPLFeature.png[width="300"]

As can be seen from the diagram, the field `ProgrammingLanuage` has been added to the student model.

Concerning the Logic component, when the `add` command or `edit` command is called,
a `Student` object with attributes including `ProgrammingLanguage` will be created/edited depending on which command was entered.

For example, adding a student would have the command string parsed for arguments in such a way:

[source, java]
----
    public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        // ...Tokenize the String Input...
        // ...Check if prefixes are present...
        try {
            // ...Parses the other fields required of a Student...
            ProgrammingLanguage programmingLanguage = ParserUtil.parseSubject(argMultimap
                    .getValue(PREFIX_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE)).get();
            Student student = new Student(name, phone, email, address, programmingLanguage, tagList);
            return new AddCommand(student);
		} catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
        }
	}
----
// tag::programmingLanguage[]
A new student would then be added. On the other hand, editing a student's programming language will be done by creating an edited student in such a way:

[source, java]
----
	private static Student createEditedStudent(Student studentToEdit, EditStudentDescriptor editStudentDescriptor) {
        assert studentToEdit != null;
        // ...Set other attributes of the prospective newly edited student...
        ProgrammingLanguage updatedProgrammingLanguage = editStudentDescriptor.getProgrammingLanguage();
        return new Student(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedProgrammingLanguage,
                updatedTags);
    }
----

The editedStudent will have the new programming language attribute and will hence be used to replace in the Address Book in-memory.

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| *How to store `ProgrammingLanguage` for a `Student`*
| *Store as an attribute of Student. (current choice)*
| + : Easy to keep track of as well as modify.  +
{empty} +
- : Coupling increases as more classes (`ProgrammingLanguage` and `Student`) are associated with each other.

| Store as a separate list and have each student index in the UniqueStudentsList be mapped to each item in the list.
| + : Less coupling so less need to refactor code +
{empty} +
- : Might be messier to implement, especially if the UniqueStudentsList have it's students swapping indexes.

.2+| *What command to add `ProgrammingLanguage` to `Student`*
| *Implement it through the existing `add` command. (current choice)*
| + : Intuitive and the user does not have to learn an additional command +
{empty} +
- : User will have to type a longer string for add command to include the programming language used by the student.

| Implement it as a new command.
| + : User will be able to add or modify `ProgrammingLanguage` one or possibly even a few students at their own discretion. +
{empty} +
- : User will have to learn a new specific command and might also be slightly difficult to implement.

|=======================================================================
// end::programmingLanguage[]


=== Profile Page feature
The profile page feature allows the user to view the full information of contacts(students) kept in their data. This page has each student's main info, miscellaneous info, and their profle picture.

==== Current Implementation
Users will also be able to edit the miscellaneous information of a student as well as his/her profile picture. The profile picture is changed by providing a file path to the actual picture file.

[NOTE]
The picture file to be changed to must be a valid and existing file with extensions of `.png` or `.jpg`

The following diagram shows the student model including the primary attributes as well as the miscellaneous information attributes.

image::StudentWithMiscInfoDiagram.png[width="300"]

When a student is added by the `addCommand`, the `MiscellaneousInfo` and `ProfilePicturePath` of the student will be set to these default values:

* Allergies, NextOfKinName, Remarks will be set to `Not updated`.
* NextOfKinPhone will be set to `000`.
* ProfilePicturePath will be set to the path of a profile photo placeholder within the app.


This feature revolves mainly around 3 commands:

. `moreInfo` : Shows the actual profile page on the web browser.
. `editMisc` : Edits the miscellaneous information of a student.
. `editPicture` : Edits the profile picture of a student with a valid picture file(refer to note above). The user will have to provide the filepath to this file.
// tag::profilePage1[]
[large]*`moreInfo` Command*

For the command `moreInfo`, the model manager calls upon the data storage (addressbook) to raise an event for the Browser Panel to display the profile page of a student.

[WARNING]
The `moreInfo` command *cannot* function if there is no real existing XML data of students. Thus, the sample student data provided at the initial start up will not work with this command. A warning will be mentioned if the command is called without existing data.

The code below shows how the the method is called with the parameter of the required `Student` functions:

[source, java]
----
	public void displayStudentDetailsOnBrowserPanel(Student target) throws StudentNotFoundException,
            StorageFileMissingException {
        addressBook.checkForStudentInAddressBook(target);
        checkIfStorageFileExists();
        indicateRequiredStudentIndexChange(filteredStudents.indexOf(target));
        indicateBrowserPanelToDisplayStudent(target);
    }

----
The method `checkIfStorageFileExists()` checks if there is any real XML data of students at the moment. If none exists, then an exception is thrown and the command will not perform (as mentioned in the note above).
The method `indicateRequiredStudentIndexChange(Index indexOfStudent)` calls the modifying of XML data of which student is needed to display his/her profile page. This is because the HTML files
can only read data from XML files and hence, an external XML file containing the index of the student whose profile page is required to be shown is needed.

Lastly, indicating the browser panel to display a student will raise a `StudentInfoDisplayEvent` which is handled in the `BrowserPanel` with the following code:

[source, java]
----
	private void handleStudentInfoDisplayEvent(StudentInfoDisplayEvent event) {
		//... logging process...
		loadStudentInfoPage();
		//... raising event to switch panels...
	}
----

The diagram below shows how the event is handled in the `BrowserPanel` :

image::moreInfoCommandSD.png[width:400]
//end::profilePage1[]
[large]*`editMisc` Command*

For the command `editMisc`, this is similar to the edit function, except it takes on different optional parameters. These are [ALLERGIES], [NEXTOFKINNAME], [NEXTOFKINPHONE], [REMARKS].
The code snippet below shows how the `studentToEdit` is created when the `editMisc command` is called.
[source, java]
----
	private static Student createEditedStudent(Student studentToEdit, EditMiscDescriptor editMiscDescriptor) {
		assert studentToEdit != null;
		//... main information of the student is copied over...
		Allergies allergies = editMiscDescriptor.getAllergies()
				.orElse(studentToEdit.getMiscellaneousInfo().getAllergies());
		NextOfKinName nextOfKinName = editMiscDescriptor.getNextOfKinName()
				.orElse(studentToEdit.getMiscellaneousInfo().getNextOfKinName());
		NextOfKinPhone nextOfKinPhone = editMiscDescriptor.getNextOfKinPhone()
				.orElse(studentToEdit.getMiscellaneousInfo().getNextOfKinPhone());
		Remarks remarks = editMiscDescriptor.getRemarks()
				.orElse(studentToEdit.getMiscellaneousInfo().getRemarks());
		MiscellaneousInfo miscellaneousInfo = new MiscellaneousInfo(allergies, nextOfKinName, nextOfKinPhone, remarks);

		return new Student(uniqueKey, name, phone, email, address,
				programmingLanguage, tags, isFavourite, dashboard, profilePicturePath, miscellaneousInfo);
}
----

After that, the student will be updated with the new details for his/her miscellaneous information.

//tag::profilePage2[]
[large]*`editPicture` Command*

For the command `editPicture`, the student's index will have to be provided by the user again. The next parameter for this is the required file path of the picture file.
This can be in the form of an absolute file path (starting from a hardrive like `C:/Users/.../picture.png`) or relative to the folder that the jar application is in.


This command uses the similar method of the `edit` command and the `editMisc` command where a new `Student` with the edited details is created to overwrite the current existing student.
In this case, the `ProfilePicturePath` of the student is edited. When this command is called, a `ProfilePictureChangeEvent` will be raised and the Storage Manager will call a method to save the data of the profile picture from its original location to a location in the jar folder.

The code below shows how the saving of the file is done:

[source, java]
----
	public void saveProfilePicture(ProfilePicturePath pathToChangeTo, Student student) throws IOException {
		//... ensuring that the picture's filepath exists
		//... getting the extension of the provided filepath of the picture
		deleteExistingProfilePicture(studentPictureFilePath);
		Path studentPictureFilePathWithExtension = Paths.get(studentPictureFilePath.toString() + extension);
		logger.fine("Attempting to write to data file: data/" + student.getUniqueKey().toString());
		Files.copy(newPath, studentPictureFilePathWithExtension);
    }
----

Thus, the HTML file for displaying the student's profile page will be able to show the new image, which is copied to the local jar folder.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of calling the `editPicture` command.

.Sequence diagram showing the important details of the process of the `editPicture` command
image::editPictureCommandSD.png[width:600]
//end::profilePage2[]
As seen from the above diagram, the `createFinalEditedStudent()` method ensures that the correct profile picture path is saved onto the student's XML data in order to be read by the HTML file which displays the student profile page.
The method `createEditedStudent` creates the student wi

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule feature
==== Current Implementation
To get better control of one's weekly schedule, we will now attach a component called `Schedule` to `Model`.

At startup, a new `Schedule` object is instantiated in `ModelManager`.

A `Schedule` has a `LessonList`, it contains an `ObservableList<Lesson>` internalList attribute, which stores all the `Lesson` objects that describes your schedule.
The UI is bounded to this `LessonList` so that it can automatically update when data changes.

A `Lesson` has a `UniqueKey` attribute, a `Day` attribute, a starting `TIME START_TIME` and an ending `TIME END_TIME` attribute.
`Lesson` objects are created by the `addLesson` command.

image::LessonClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Implementation of commands that edit your Schedule

Commands that modify the schedule are `addLesson` and `deleteLesson`.
Editing a student's name will edit the name of the event in the schedule.
Deleting a student will also delete all his lessons in the schedule.

* Students have the `UniqueKey` field, which we will now use in `Lesson` to create a relation to Student objects.
* A `Lesson` object called `newLesson` will be created by `ModelManager.addLesson(UniqueKey key, Day day, Time startTime, Time endTime)`, which is implemented as such:

[source, java]
----
    public void addLesson(Student studentToAddLesson, Day day, Time startTime, Time endTime) {
        requireAllNonNull(studentToAddLesson, day, startTime, endTime);
        UniqueKey studentKey = studentToAddLesson.getUniqueKey();
        Lesson newLesson = new Lesson(studentKey, day, startTime, endTime);
        schedule.addLesson(newLesson);
        indicateScheduleChanged();
    }
----

A sequence diagram of the result can be seen from the below diagram.

.Sequence Diagram of `addLesson` command
image::AddLessonSequenceDiagram.png[width='800']

The student will be selected by the Index of the last seen list of students.
The UniqueKey is then retrieved from the Student. A new `Lesson` will now be added for that student at the specific `Day`, `startTime` and `endTime`, associated with the Student by the `key`

No `Lesson` objects can be created for students not in contact list.

[NOTE]
If you have a future implementation that requires the addition of a new attribute in the `Schedule` class, you must take note of updating the `Model.addLesson(Student, Day, Time START_TIME, Time END_TIME)` method to reflect the new attribute.

===== Implementation of viewing your Schedule

The `schedule` command displays of a student’s dashboard. The `schedule` command is implemented this way:

.Sequence Diagram of `schedule` command
image::ScheduleCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width='800']

From the following diagram,

. `InfoPanel` handles the `showScheduleEvent` event. It changes the view to the `CalendarPanel`, hiding `DashboardPanel` and `BrowserPanel`.
. `InfoPanel` raises the `showScheduleEvent` which is also handled by `CalendarPanel` to display the lessons of the student in the schedule.

=== Google Service Integration


To sync with Google Contacts and Google Calendar, a `GServiceManager` class is implemented to handle the 2 services.
`GServiceManager` contains a `GContactsService` and `GCalendarService` objects. `GServiceManager.synchronize` calls `GContactsService.synchronize` and
`GCalendarService.synchronize`

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

Google Contacts and Calendar APIs require an external libaries. Remember to add the following to your dependencies

[source, java]
--------
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.api-client:google-api-client:1.23.0'
    compile 'com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client-jetty:1.23.0'

|=======================================================================
// end::schedule[]


// tag::dashboard[]
=== Dashboard feature

The dashboard feature aims to help users keep track of their students' learning progress.

==== Current Implementation

To have a dashboard for each student, an association with a new `Dashboard` class is added to the `Student` class. We have also created new classes associated with the `Dashboard` class to facilitate the different capabilities of the dashboard.
The following diagram shows the class diagram of the components that facilitate the dashboard feature:

.Class diagram of the components that facilitate the dashboard feature
image::ModelComponentDashboardClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

Both `UniqueMilestoneList` and `UniqueTaskList` contain an attribute called "internalList" which are `ObservableList<Milestone>` and `ObservableList<Task>` respectively.
This means that the UI can be bound to both of the lists so that it can automatically update when the data in any of the lists change.

A new `Dashboard` object is created every time a new `Student` is being created. The `Dashboard` object will contain an empty milestone list until the user adds new milestones to the dashboard.
This enforces 1-to-1 association between `Student` and `Dashboard`, as well as between `Dashboard` and `UniqueMilestoneList`.

For example, the constructor for `Student` is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
    public Student(Name name, Phone phone, Email email, Address address, ProgrammingLanguage programmingLanguage, Set<Tag> tags) {
        requireAllNonNull(name, phone, email, address, tags);
        this.name = name;
        this.phone = phone;
        // ... initialise the rest of the attributes ...
        this.dashboard = new Dashboard();
    }
----

The constructor for `Dashboard` is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
    public Dashboard() {
        milestoneList = new UniqueMilestoneList();
    }
----

===== Implementation for commands that modify the Dashboard

The `AddMilestoneCommand`, `AddTaskCommand`, `CheckTaskCommand` and `ShowDashboardCommand` commands facilitate operations to the dashboard.
A common implementation for commands that modify the dashboard (e.g. `AddMilestoneCommand`) is that a new copy of `Dashboard` is created with the new modification.

For example, in the `AddMilestoneCommand`, to add a new milestone object to the dashboard of a `Student` Object called "targetStudent":

. `AddMilestoneCommand.preprocessUndoableCommand()` calls the `AddMilestoneCommand.createEditedStudent()` method which will create a `Student` object called "editedStudent".
"editedStudent" is created with the same attributes of "targetStudent", but with a new `Dashboard` object containing the new milestone. +
`AddMilestoneCommand.createEditedStudent()` is implemented as such:

[source, java]
----
    private void createEditedStudent() throws DuplicateMilestoneException {
        requireAllNonNull(studentToEdit, newMilestone);
        editedStudent = new StudentBuilder(targetStudent).withNewMilestone(newMilestone).build();
    }
----
[start=2]
. In the `AddMilestoneCommand.executeUndoableCommand()` method, `Model.updateStudent(Student, Student)` is called to replace "targetStudent" with "editedStudent" in the Address Book in-memory.

===== Implementation for displaying the dashboard

The `ShowDashboardCommand` facilitates the displaying of a student's dashboard. The `ShowDashboardCommand.execute()` method is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        // ... check whether targetIndex is valid ...
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowStudentDashboardEvent(lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased())));
        // ... return command result ...
    }
----
As seen from the above code snippet, `ShowDashboardCommand.execute()` raises a `ShowStudentDashboardEvent`. The sequence diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event.

.Sequence diagram showing how the the `EventsCenter` and the Ui components react to the `ShowDashboardCommand`
image::ShowDashboardCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As seen from the above diagram,

. `InfoPanel` handles the `ShowStudentInDashboard` event. +
. `InfoPanel` then raises the `ShowStudentNameInDashboard` which is handled by `DashboardPanel` to display the name of the student in the dashboard. +
. Finally, `InfoPanel` raises the `ShowMilestoneEvent` which is also handled by `DashboardPanel` to display the milestones of the student in the dashboard.

=== Natural Language Processing capabilities
Allows users to invoke features using free-form english, apart from keywords specific to each feature.

==== Current implementation

An AI bot(agent) that is trained to process sentences based on the features integrated is into the application.
Its primary goal is to identify the user's intention of the input and match it with a corresponding feature which the
user wishes to use.

A new class `ConversationCommand` is written to process sentences that do not match the syntax of any features.

===== Making API calls via the REST API
The method below, written using the IBM Watson™ Assistant service API, is used to make the API call to the agent.
The `userInput` field contains the sentence that the user inputs.
----
    public static MessageResponse getMessageResponse(String userInput) {
        MessageResponse response = null;

        InputData input = new InputData.Builder(userInput).build();
        MessageOptions option = new MessageOptions.Builder("19f7b6f4-7944-419d-83a0-6bf9837ec333").input(input).build();
        response = service.message(option).execute();

        return response;
    }
----
===== Intents and Entities

*Intents* refers to the intention behind the input of the user and *entities* refer to objects of interest e.g. name, address, location

The agent is integrated into the `AddressBookParser` class and the following code snippet deciphers the *intents*
and the *entity* embedded in the user's input.

----
            //processes the userInput
            response = ConversationCommand.getMessageResponse(userInput);
            intents = response.getIntents();
            entities = response.getEntities();

            for (int i = 0; i < intents.size(); i++) {
                intention = intents.get(i).getIntent();
            }

            if (entities.size() != 0) {
                for (int i = 0; i < intents.size(); i++) {
                    entity = entities.get(i).getValue();
                }
            }
----

[IMPORTANT]
Every single input always has an *intent*, but that is not the case for *entities*!

For further clarification, refer to the screenshot below:

.Example of an intention and an entity, with its corresponding value. The intention is `Select` and the entity refers to the name of a person, which takes on a value of `Jason` in this particular case.
image::debug_message.PNG[width="700"]

===== Matching the desired command
After identifying the *intent* and *entities* (if present) in the user's input, the corresponding features matching intent is called,
passing any *entities* as parameters to the feature's method.

.Following the example in Figure 12, the `select` command is invoked, passing `Jason` as a parameter, after the intent and entity is identified.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
