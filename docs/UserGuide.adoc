== Introduction

Smart Insurance Collection(SIC) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments*. More importantly, SIC is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB4 can get your contact and appointment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 i/29000 as/1000 age/20` : adds a contact
named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the address book to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +

`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

// end::undoredo[]

=== Predict: `predict`
Predict the potential spending of the of a new customer. Some of the customers have
their "actual spending" recorded down while some don't have because they have
not spent anything yet on the insurance policy. Hence this command is to
predict how much they will spend based on the information from the existing customers

Examples:

* `Initially` +
two customers with `actualSpending` > 0 while the other with
`actualSpending` == 0(actual spending will actually not be shown
if it is zero).

* `After` +
The customer with `actualSpending` == 0 now has `expectedSpending` shown.

Other Specification:

* The solution is persistent. Hence when new users are added and old users are deleted,
the new solutions are calculated incrementally from the old solution.

*  When adding an new `Person`, the `/as`(Actual Spending) is optional.
if the actual spending is specified, the person is considered as existing
customer. Otherwise potential customer. The prediction is to predict
the potential customer's spending based on the information on the
existing customers.

* The solution is calculated through numerical methods. And numerical methods,
unlike Jesus, can't solve everything. There are certain inputs that will lead
to divergent solution. Also, certain value might be too large to be captured
even with double. Hence in situations like this, an message of "Divergent solution"
would be presented with no prediction.

* Like "help" command, the design is fault-tolerant. If you type extra text such
as `predict abcde` or `predict nothing please`, those are not valid command since
`predict` takes no other argument. But they will still be accepted as `predict`

Test input: +
    1. `add n/John One p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney i/30000 as/1500 age/20` +

    3. `add n/John Three p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney i/10000  age/20` +
    4. `predict` +

    ==>  John Three now shows expected spending of 500

    4. `predict` +

    ==>  John Three should have 666.67 expected spending

Test Input 3: +
    0. `clear` +
    1. `add n/John One p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney i/12345678000 as/150 age/20` +
