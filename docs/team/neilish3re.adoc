== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to sort Coin List*
** What it does: allows the user to sort list of coins by lexicographical order.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make arrange his coins in such a way that is easier for him to view and find the desired coin he wants to interact with, especially if said user has a diverse and big portfolio to deal with.
** Highlights: This enhancement does not affect any existing commands and is a standalone feature. It did not require in-depth analysis however the implementation was relatively challenging as some understanding of the inter-link between the ParserUtil, CoinBookParser, ModelManager and Model classes was essential in figuring out how to eventually make the SortCommand function come to fruition.
** Credits: _Required some help to search other implementations of other sort functions in order to understand how to apply it for our own CoinBook_
* *Minor enhancement*: added an additional option that allows for sorting by reverse alphabetical order by adding another case.
