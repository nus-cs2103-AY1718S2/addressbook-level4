== Introduction

SmartSplit is a desktop app for managing shared expenses between contacts. More importantly, SmartSplit is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartSplit can get your shared expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `smartsplit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SmartSplit app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

// end::select[]

// tag::addTransaction[]
=== Adding a transaction: `addTransaction` `[Since v1.2]` `[Updated for v1.5]`

Adds a transaction between one payer and one or multiple payees for payment transaction. +
Format with 1 Payee: `addTransaction type/TRANSACTION TYPE payer/PAYER NAME a/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION payee/PAYEE NAME m/SPLIT METHOD [units/LIST OF UNITS] [percentages/LIST OF PERCENTAGES]` +
Format with more than 1 Payee (e.g. 2 Payees): `addTransaction type/TRANSACTION TYPE payer/PAYER NAME a/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION payee/PAYEE NAME payee/PAYEE NAME m/SPLIT METHOD [units/LIST OF UNITS] [percentages/LIST OF PERCENTAGES]`

****
* The options for transaction type are: *payment* and *paydebt*.
** *payment* is for recording a transaction that was paid by a person on behalf of himself/herself and other persons.
** *paydebt* is for recording a transaction that reduces an existing debt owed to another person. *Only 1 payee is allowed.*
A paydebt transaction can only be made if the payer owes the payee a balance. The amount specified cannot exceed this balance.
* The options for split method are: *evenly*, *units*, and *percentage*. If no method is specified, the transaction will default to split evenly.
** Only specify a split method if the transaction type is *payment*.
** If *units* is selected as the split method, a list of integers representing the units must be entered as a comma-separated list. The first integer is the number of units
associated with the payer. Each subsequent integer is associated with each payee in the order in which they are specified in the command. The amount that each involved
person owes is calculated by the following: +
Amount Owed = Transaction Amount * (Units for the Person / Total Number of Units)
** If *percentage* is selected as the split method, a list of integers representing the percentages must be entered as a comma-separated list. The first integer is the percentage
associated with the payer. Each subsequent integer is associated with each payee in the order in which they are specified in the command. *The percentages must add up to 100*.
The amount that each involved person owes is calculated by the following: +
Amount Owed = Transaction Amount * (Percentage for the Person / 100)
* The names for the payer and payee(s) used in the transaction must be in the SmartSplit addressbook.
* At least one payee is required. There is no limit to how many unique payees that may be added as long as they exist in the SmartSplit addressbook.
* A payee cannot be the payer.
* The amount must be a positive number with exactly two decimals.
* The description must not be empty.
****

[TIP]
Payer or payee(s) indicated in the transaction must exist.
For paydebt transaction, the debt must be present and the amount indicated must be less than or equal to the outstanding debt

Examples:

1. `addTransaction type/payment payer/John Doe a/1000.00 d/Fancy dinner payee/Tom Riddle`
* Adds a transaction where John Doe paid $1000.00. This is split evenly by default with Tom Riddle.
Thus, the total amount spent by John Doe and by Tom Riddle will each increase by 500.00.

image::AddTransactionExampleSplitEvenlySuccess.png[width="800"]

2. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Betsy Crowe a/30.00 d/Team T-shirts payee/John Doe payee/Bernice Yu m/units units/1, 2, 3`
* Adds a transaction where Betsy Crowe paid $30.00 for team t-shirts. The split method is by units with a split of
"1, 2, 3". The total number of units is 6. Thus, Betsy Crowe's total amount spent will increase by 30.00 * (1/6) = 5.00. Similarly, John Doe's
 total amount spent will increase by 10.00 and Bernice Yu's total amount spent will increase by 15.00.

image::AddTransactionExampleSplitByUnitsSuccess.png[width="800"]

3. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Steven Jia a/50.00 d/Taxi ride payee/Paul Mignot payee/Kok Cong Ong m/percentage percentage/50, 10, 10`
* The *addTransaction* command fails because the sum of the percentages is not 100.

4. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Steven Jia a/50.00 d/Taxi ride payee/Paul Mignot payee/Kok Cong Ong m/percentage percentage/38, 28, 34`
* Adds a transaction where Steven Jia paid $50.00 for a shared taxi ride. The split method is by percentage with a split of
"38, 28, 34". Thus, Steven Jia's total amount spent will increase by 50.00 * (38/100) = 19.00. Similarly, Paul Mignot's
total amount spent will increase by 14.00 and Kok Cong Ong's total amount spent will increase by 17.00.

image::AddTransactionExampleSplitByPercentageSuccess.png[width="800"]

5. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Tom Riddle a/500.00 d/Pay John for last night's dinner payee/John Doe`
* Adds a transaction where Tom Riddle paid John Doe $500.00.

6. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Bernice Yu a/15.00 d/Pay Betsy for last night's dinner payee/Betsy Crowe payee/John Doe`
* The *addTransaction* command fails because there is more than 1 payee when the transaction type is *paydebt*.

7. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Bernice Yu a/15.00 d/Pay Betsy for last night's dinner payee/John Doe`
* Assuming that Betsy paid for the dinner and John did not, Bernice does not actually owe John any amount.
The *addTransaction* command fails because the payer does not owe the payee any amount.

8. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Bernice Yu a/30.00 d/Pay Betsy for last night's dinner payee/Betsy Crowe`
* Assuming that Bernice only owes Betsy $15.00 for the dinner last night, the *addTransaction* command fails
because the payer is overpaying the payee.

// end::addTransaction[]
=== Deleting a transaction : `deleteTransaction` `[Since v1.2]`

Deletes the specified transaction from SmartSplit. +
Format: `deleteTransaction INDEX`

****
* Deletes the transaction at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* All persons involved in the transaction must still be in the SmartSplit addressbook.
****

[TIP]

Payer or payee(s) in the transaction to be deleted must exist.
Do not delete a payment transaction after a paydebt transaction with respect to that payment transaction had been made, as we assumed that payment transaction is not a wrongly added transaction after a paydebt transaction has made.

Example:

* `deleteTransaction 2` +
Deletes the 2nd transaction in the SmartSplit transactions list.

=== Locating transactions by name: `findTransaction` `[Coming in v2.0]`

Finds transactions whose property values contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findTransaction KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `monthly rent` will match `Monthly Rent`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Rent Monthly` will match `Monthly Rent`
* All fields are searched.
* Only full words or numbers will be matched e.g. `Month` will not match `Monthly`
* Transactions matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
e.g. `Monthly` will return transactions with descriptions such as `Monthly Rent`, `Monthly Netflix Subscription`
****

Examples:

* `findTransaction Groceries` +
Returns `FairPrice groceries` and `Cheers groceries`
* `find 90.25 Jonathan Food` +
Returns any transaction with fields that have the values `90.25`, `Jonathan`, or `Food`

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
