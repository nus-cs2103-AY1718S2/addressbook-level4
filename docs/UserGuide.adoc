[[Using_Commands]]
=== Using Commands

.*Getting started with Commands*
****

====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
** An example in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Fields that are in enclosed with `[ ]` are optional.
** An example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, can be used as, `n/John Doe t/friend`, or as, `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
** In this example, `[t/TAG]...`, these parameters are valid, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, and even `{nbsp}` (no parameter).
* Parameters can be entered in any order.
** For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====
****

.*The Use of Alias*
****

====
* Some commands have an alias that you can use to execute the command. This alias acts as a shortcut to execute the commands you want without typing the full command out.
** For example, you can type the alias `a` instead of the `add` command word to add a player into MTM.
====
****

.*Lookout for Tips, Notes, and Expected Outcomes*
****

====
TIP: This box give _tips_ that *might be useful*.

NOTE: This box _notes_ down *important details* regarding a feature.

IMPORTANT: This box will let you know the _outcome_ and what MTM should be *expected to do*.

then a dropdown box will appear with the possible commands. These can be navigated using mouse or arrow keys. Press enter to select the desired command.
