== PROJECT: MoVie Planner (MVP) - V1.5

---

== Overview

MoVie Planner (MVP) is a desktop application that aims to help cinema managers manage the schedule of movies in
different cinemas.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added scheduling system.
** What it does: Allows the user to add or delete a movie screening in a cinema.
** Justification: This feature makes cinema schedule planning much easier because the user can add a movie screening to a cinema's theater
 without worrying about variables such as preparation delay and advertisement time. These variables are calculated automatically in MVP
 to see if a screening can be added to the cinema's theater. Once added, the screening will be displayed for the user to view the schedule.
** Highlights: This enhancement interacts heavily with existing model and requires deep consideration
on areas such as storage and ui. Displaying the schedule also affects existing commands and it requires careful testing.
I have also added a jump command for user to navigate the dates in the schedule.
** Credits: CalendarFX API

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a panel to display the list of movies.
