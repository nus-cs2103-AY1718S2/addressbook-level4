== PROJECT: Investigapptor

---

== Overview

Investigapptor is a desktop application used for investigators to manage cases as simple, straightforward and efficient as possible. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *support for managing investigation cases*
** What it does: allows the user to add, delete, edit, find, and view case details in Investigapptor using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
** Justification: As Investigapptor is a tool for managing investigations, the ability to store, modify, and view case information is integral to the functionality of the application. This feature aims to eliminate the need for paper-based processing during investigations, and give investigators a platform to access the data that they need more easily and efficiently.
** Highlights: This enhancement touched on the logic, model, storage, and UI components. In the model component, a new package had to be introduced to store case information.

* *Minor enhancement*: updated the GUI with a new colour scheme and style https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F14-B3/main/pull/185[#185]
