* Club Connect is a desktop application. It has a <<DeveloperGuide#gui,GUI>> but most of the user interactions happen using a <<DeveloperGuide#cli,CLI>>.
* Club Connect is targeted at student organizations (such as clubs and societies) that are characterized by a well-established hierarchy.
* Student organizations require a one-stop destination for all their managerial needs when it comes to enrollment, delegating tasks, preparing for events, and opening polls and feedback systems.
* Student organizations can have hundreds of members which are further divided into sub-committees that have narrower focuses. These subcommittee members are often assigned individual tasks. With time, it will get very difficult to keep track of everything.
* Club Connect is the solution to this problem as it helps <<DeveloperGuide#club,clubs>> manage and organize their activities and members efficiently and effectively.
* Club Connect has the following features:
** <<DeveloperGuide#exco-member,Exco Members>> can manage the member roster
** Exco Members can delegate tasks to Sub-Committee Members
** Exco Members can set up polls and feedback surveys
** <<DeveloperGuide#member,Members>> can send e-mails to any other members
** Members can keep track of upcoming events and deadlines for tasks
