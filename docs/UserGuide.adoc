[[Features]]
== Features

// tag::command-format[]
[[CommandFormat]]
*Command Format*

Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user. For example:

* `add name/NAME calories/CALORIES`, *_NAME_* and *_CALORIES_* are parameters which can be substituted in this manner *`add name/Chicken rice calories/500`*.
* `add name/NAME ingredient/INGREDIENT instruction/INSTRUCTION`,*_NAME_*, *_INGREDIENT_* and *_INSTRUCTION_* are parameters which can be substituted in this manner *`add name/Chicken rice ingredient/chicken, rice instruction/cut chicken into strips before cooking`*.
* Below is a list of the remaining parameters with examples of their acceptable formats:

** *_INGREDIENT_* is a list of ingredients, delimited by commas. E.g. `chicken,fish,rice` and `chicken, fish, rice` are valid.
** *_INSTRUCTION_* can receive multiple lines as its value.
** *_PREPARATION_TIME_* and *_COOKING_TIME_* fields accept a number of formats: `1h20m`, `1h20min`, `1 hour 20 minutes`, `80m`, `80min`, `80 mins`, etc. However, sticking to the most simple format `80m` is recommended.
** *_CALORIES_* and *_SERVINGS_* are positive numbers. E.g. `120`, `5000`, etc.
** *_URL_* takes a valid website address as its value. E.g. `http://google.com`.
** *_IMAGE_* takes a valid image path as its value (E.g. for macOS: `/Users/administrator/Desktop/image.png`, for Windows: `C:\Users\admin\image.png`). Or it can also be a valid image URL, for example, `https://i.imgur.com/FhRsgCK.jpg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as *`name/Chicken rice tag/chicken`* or as *`name/Chicken rice`*.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), *`tag/rice`*, *`tag/rice tag/chicken`*, or `ingredient KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...` can be used as `ingredient chicken rice salt`.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `name/RECIPE_NAME instruction/INSTRUCTION`, `instruction/INSTRUCTION name/RECIPE_NAME` has the same effect.
* White spaces after a slash are automatically trimmed. For example, `add name/ Chicken rice` and `add name/Chicken rice` are the same. However, the former is more visually pleasing.
* You can split a command into multiple lines for ease of input.
// end::command-format[]

// tag::app-navigation[]
[[Navigation]]
*Navigation*

* Press kbd:[Enter] while holding down kbd:[Shift] to add a new line to your input.
* Press kbd:[Enter] to submit a command.
* Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows while holding down kbd:[Ctrl] will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.

// end::app-navigation[]

// tag::auto-completion[]
[[Auto-completion]]
*Auto-completion*

* Press kbd:[Tab] while holding down kbd:[Shift] to display a list of suggestions for your input. The list will contain application keywords (i.e, commands, field prefixes in commands) that match your current input. If there are words matching your input, they will be shown in alphabetical order. If there is no word found, the list will not be displayed.
** If you did not type anything, the list will suggest the first commands.
** If you are typing the first word, the list will suggest some commands that match your current input. For example, if you are typing *`a`*, some commands starting with *`a`* will be displayed.
** If you are typing not the first word, there are two possible cases:
*** The first word you typed is not a command keyword, then the list will suggest some commands that match your last word (can be empty string if you have a whitespace at the end of your input).
*** The first word you typed is a command keyword, then the list will suggest some possible field prefixes of that command. If the command has no field prefix, the list will not be displayed.
* Press kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] to choose a suggestion you want.
* Press kbd:[Enter] to choose the suggestion.
* The suggestion will be added to your input automatically.
** If you choose a command keyword, it will replace your current input with the command and possible field prefixes (may be none, some or all possible field prefixes, depending on command).
** If you choose a field prefix, it will replace the word right before the caret (i.e, the word used to find suggestion).

[NOTE]
If you choose auto-completion for a command, your input will be cleared and replaced by the command with field prefixes (if any).

[[faq]]
== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ReciRecipé.

*Q*: Where do I find my data file? +
*A*: image:FAQ2.PNG[width="450"]
{nbsp}

*Q*: There is still something I don't understand after reading this guide! +
*A*: Please https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/issues[create a new issue in our repo] about what you're confused about. We will try our best to answer your query.

*Q*: None of the commands work! Why? +
*A*: Are you copying from the *command* section instead of the *example* section? If you want to use `add name/RECIPE_NAME [ingredient/INGREDIENT]`, a valid command would be *`add name/Chicken rice ingredient/chicken, rice`* instead of *`add name/Chicken rice [ingredient/chicken, rice]`*.

*Q*: ReciRecipé doesn't appear when I double click _recipebook.jar_! What should I do? +
*A*: If you are using Windows and ReciRecipé doesn't appear, it might be due to conflicting versions of JRE. +
As a work around, hold kbd:[Shift] and right click on any blank space in the folder you are using as the home folder for ReciRecipé (refer to <<right-click-windows>>). +
[[right-click-windows]]
.Windows context menu
image::WindowsContext.PNG[width="276"]
{nbsp} +
Select *Open command window here* (earlier versions of Windows) or *Open PowerShell window here* (Windows 10), type in `java -jar recipebook.jar`. +
After this step, you should get something like <<powershell>> or <<cmd>> depending on the version of Windows you are running:
[[powershell]]
.Windows PowerShell
image::WindowsPowerShell.PNG[width="400"]
[[cmd]]
.Windows command
image::WindowsCMD.PNG[width="400"]
{nbsp} +
Then press kbd:[Enter] to launch ReciRecipé.

*Q*: I cannot add an online image to my recipe! Why? +
*A*: Please check if your device is connected to the Internet. Image downloading only works when there is an Internet connection.

== Current issues
These are issues that have been reported and might be resolved in the future:

* `parse` command does not work on some sites. +
_Currently `parse` only works with http://recipes.wikia.com/ and its children sites (both desktop and mobile versions). Support for other sites will be considered for v2.0._
* `parse` command returns results for pages that are not recipes / doesn't return result for pages that are recipes / returns incorrect results. +
_A powerful text analyzer that can parse almost anything with high accuracy is out of our product scale. However, we will try our best to improve the parser quality so that you can enjoy a better product._
* *_PREPARATION_TIME_* and *_COOKING_TIME_* accept invalid time values, e.g. `1h90m`, `200 mins 2 hours`, etc. +
_We expect you to provide ReciRecipé with a correct and valid time value like `150m` instead of `1h90m`. More restrictive formats will be considered for v2.0._
* Sometimes `add` command hangs ReciRecipé. +
_This is likely due to a tricky input that confuses our product. If you encounter such an event while using ReciRecipé, please https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F09-B2/main/issues[send us a feedback] with the input that caused the problem._
* kbd:[F1] and kbd:[F2] sometimes don't work. +
_This is a known problem with current versions of Java. We have been looking into this problem and the issue might be resolved soon._
* Big images make ReciRecipé laggy. +
_Currently, ReciRecipé does not distinguish between large and small images. You should use images under 1MB as a workaround for now. This problem will be resolved in v2.0._ +
* Suggestion list (auto-completion) sometimes does not show below caret position. +
_This is due to the limited support of `CommandBox` to get coordinates of caret inside it. We have tried to fix this but have not found an efficient solution. This problem will be resolved in v2.0. Currently, our solution is to show suggestion list at the bottom of `CommandBox` if the input text is long enough to cause the problem. If the input text is short, suggestion list will still be shown below caret position._
