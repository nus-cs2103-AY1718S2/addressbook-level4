== PROJECT: Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB)

---

== Overview

IMDB is an application for the management of health records digitally by private clinics with multiple branches. The user (either a medical staff or a doctor) interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *records for each patient and the ability to edit those records*
** What it does: allows the doctor to add, modify and delete a patient's medical records which store information pertaining to a particular visit they made to the clinic.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the doctor can track a patient's symptoms, illnesses, suspected diseases and treatments administered over a period of time. This allows a doctor to accurately gauge a patient's current health status.
** Highlights: This enhancement includes a new variable to the patient class. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as it stores a list of records, which then stored various other new classes. The implementation was challenging as it required a way to
store and retrieve a list of nested classes. Its also implemented a new window which needed to accept and authenticate user inputs to ensure a valid medical record.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a remark class and command that allows the medical staff to navigate to enter miscellaneous information of a patient that did not belong to any existing fields.
