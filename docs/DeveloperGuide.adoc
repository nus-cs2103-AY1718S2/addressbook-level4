== Introduction

Club Connect is an application targeted at club members who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier are more effective.
It provides features that are essential for a club to function smoothly such as user authentication, assigning tasks, email blasts, conducting polls, and importing and exporting member details.
This guide provides the necessary information for developers who are interested in contributing to the application - from the steps required to set-up, to detailed descriptions of the current features that the application sports.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
  It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.club.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards].
IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`.
  Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure IntelliJ to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main` repo.
If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork.
See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design
[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the .pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* (Refer to Figure 1) explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 1. Architecture Diagram_


`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for the following:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level. Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.club.commons` package.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by a component to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (Refer to Figure 2) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2. Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (Figure 3) shows how the components interact in the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3. Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ClubBookChangedEvent` when the Club Book data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below (Figure 4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4. Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them.
This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

Refer to Figure 5 for the structure of the UI component.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5. Structure of the UI Component_

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ClubBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a member) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Refer to Figure 6 for the structure of the Logic component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6. Structure of the Logic Component_

Figure 7 below shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` depicted in Figure 6.

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 7. Structure of Commands in the Logic Component._

Given below (Figure 8) is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 8. Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Club Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>` that can be 'observed'
  For example, the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

Refer to Figure 9 for the structure of the Model component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 9. Structure of the Model Component_
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Club Book data in xml format and read it back.

Refer to Figure 10 for the structure of the Storage component.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 10. Structure of the Storage Component_

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`.
It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the club book (e.g. `add`, `edit`).
Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead.
The following diagram (Refer to figure 11) shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 11. Inheritance Diagram for commands_

As you can see from the diagram (Figure 11), `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`.
Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the club book before execution.
`UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implement the details of how to execute the specific command.
Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in the child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand` - `delete 5`, to delete the 5th member in the club book.
The current state of the club book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes.
The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).
(Refer to Figure 12)

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 12. Initial state of `undoStack` and `redoStack`_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`.
For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new member (Refer to Figure 13).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 13. State of `undoStack` and `redoStack` after executing `add` command_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the member was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`.
We will restore the club book to the state before the `add` command executed (Refer to figure 14).

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 14. State of `undoStack` and `redoStack` after executing `undo` command._

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 15) shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 15. Sequence Diagram of `undo` command_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the club book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`.
This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow). (Refer to figure 16)

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 16. State of `undoStack` and `redoStack` after executing `clear` command._

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`.
For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution (Refer to Figure 17):

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 17. State of `undoStack` and `redoStack` after executing `list` command._

The following activity diagram (Figure 18) summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
_Figure 18. Activity Diagram for Undo-Redo_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`.
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour.
   Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`.
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the member being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modify the club book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`)
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data is * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: Users have no way of skipping such commands if they just want to reset the state of the club * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and can just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Furthermore, the "Single Responsibility" and "Separation of Concerns" principles are violated as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption
==== Rationale
Data encryption is key to any App that deals with personal data of individuals.

We plan to use Symmetric Key Encryption to ensure the confidentiality of data.

==== How Symmetric Key Encryption works
Symmetric key encryption is an encryption philosophy where the two communicating parties share a pre-established secret key *k*.
It consists of 2 algorithms `E` (Encrypting or Encoding) and `D` (Decryption or Decoding) which take in the same key *k* to perform their respective operations.

The 2 algorithms `E` and `D` are efficient algorithms, such that:

* *D*(*E*(*k*,m)) = m, where 'm' is the message that needs to be kept confidential.
* For *k* chosen uniformly at random, *E*(*k*,m) gives no additional information about 'm' to an adversary.

==== Proposed Implementation
We plan to make use of classes that are defined in Javax's Crypto package.

The classes that would feature in the implementation are:

* KeyGenerator -> constructs a secret (symmetric) key.
* Cipher ->  provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for encryption and decryption.

The construction of a symmetric key is done by passing the algorithm the encryption will use.
We plan to use the Advanced Encryption Scheme (AES) algorithm. For that reason, we will use a 128-bit AES symmetric key.

Once the key is generated, all data will be encrypted with AES. Anyone who wishes to view the decrypted form of the data must possess the secret key.
// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::email[]
=== Email Mechanism
==== Current Implementation
The `email` mechanism of Club Connect is facilitated by the `EmailCommand` class and is event-driven.
The `EmailCommand` consists of the following fields:

* Client - the mail client used to send the email (currently restricted to GMail and Outlook).
* Subject - the subject of the email (optional field).
* Body - the body of the email (optional field).
* Group - the club group to whom the user wishes to send an email to.
* Tag - the tag to which the user wishes to send an email to.

[NOTE]
Emails can only be sent to members belonging to EITHER a Group OR a Tag.
ClubConnect currently doesn't support sending emails to members belonging to BOTH a Group and a Tag.

The `EmailCommand` extends from `Command` and not from `UndoableCommand`, as it is not an undoable command.
Refer to Figure 19 for the UML diagram.

image::EmailCommandUML.png[width="600"]
_Figure 19. EmailCommand UML Diagram_

`EmailCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the `email` command. It returns a `EmailCommand` object after parsing `Client`, `Subject`, `Body`, `Group`, and `Tag`.
Figure 20 depicts the sequence of parsing the command.

image::SDforEmailCommandParser.png[width="650"]
_Figure 20. Sequence Diagram for Email Command parsing_

[NOTE]
Since `Subject` and `Body` are optional fields, their default values are `EMPTY_SUBJECT_STRING` and `EMPTY_BODY_STRING` which store blank Strings.

[NOTE]
As ClubConnect only allows emails to be sent to members of EITHER a `Group` OR a `Tag`, a valid command will result in either one of them being assigned to `null`.

The `EmailCommand#execute()` calls the following methods of `model`:

. ```generateEmailRecipients()``` - takes in a `Group` and `Tag` object. Depending on the object that is not `null`, it returns a string of recipients.
. ```sendEmail()``` - takes in the recipient string, and an object each of `Client`, `Subject`, and `Body`.

`EmailCommand#sendEmail()` raises an event `SendEmailRequestEvent`, which triggers the system's default browser to open the chosen mail client's 'Compose Message' page with all the relevant fields filled-in.
Figure 21 depicts the high-level sequence of events that take place.

image::SDforEmail.png[width="800"]
_Figure 21. Sequence Diagram for Email Command_


The browser URL for composing the email is generated as follows:

[source, java]
----
public static final String GMAIL_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&source=mailto&to=%1$s&su=%2$s&body=%3$s

public static final String OUTLOOK_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://outlook.office.com/?path=/mail/action/compose&to=%1$s&subject=%2$s&body=%3$s";

Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI(String.format(GMAIL_EMAIL_URL, recipients, subject, body)));
----


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Location of opening the mail client
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Open up the mail client in system's default web browser.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Since ClubConnect can be used by multiple people via user authentication, the default browser will have the owner of the system logged into his/her mail account.
* **Alternative 2:** Open up the mail client in `BrowserPanel`.
** Pros: No dependency on third party apps.
** Cons: Older version browser will disallow auto-filling of email fields.
// end::email[]

// tag::profilephoto[]
=== Changing Profile Photo Mechanism
==== Current Implementation

The `changepic` mechanism of Club Connect is facilitated by the `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand` class and is event-driven.
It allows members to modify their profile photos displayed in the application.
To facilitate this, it makes use of the `ProfilePhoto` class. `ProfilePhoto`

Currently, the `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand` extends from the `Command` class, and not from `UndoableCommand`.
Refer to Figure 22 for the UML diagram.
The `ProfilePhoto` class consists of a `String` attribute to store the file path of the profile photo.

image::ChangeProfilePhotoCommandUML.png[width="350"]
_Figure 22. ChangeProfilePhotoCommand UML Diagram_

The `displaypic` command involves the use of multiple components of Club Connect.
Below, Figure 23 shows the interactions betweeen these components.
As you can see, the `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand` is driven by the `ProfilePhotoChangedEvent`.

image::SDforChangeProfilePhoto.png[width="800"]
_Figure 23. High Level Sequence Diagram for `changepic PATH` Command_

ChangeProfilePhotoCommandParser is responsible for parsing the `changepic` command.
It returns a `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand` object after parsing the photo file path.
Figure 24 depicts the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("changepic C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/ photo.png")` API call.

image::ChangeProfilePhotoCommandSdForLogic.png[width="650"]
_Figure 24. Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `changepic C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/ photo.png` Command

The `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand#execute()` method invokes the `addProfilePhoto()` method from `model`.
Complying with the rules of <<abstraction,abstraction>>, the `Logic` component calls on `Model` to handle the internal details for updation.

The actual reading of the profile photo from the path provided is done by the `Storage` component.
It copies the photo to the Club Connect application's resources.

The code used for reading and copying the file is as follows:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void copyOriginalPhotoFile(String originalPhotoPath, String newPhotoName) throws PhotoException {
    BufferedImage originalPhoto = null;

    try {
        logger.info("Profile Photo is being read from " + originalPhotoPath);

        URL photoUrl = new URL(URL_PREFIX + originalPhotoPath);
        originalPhoto = ImageIO.read(photoUrl);

        String saveAs = newPhotoName + FILE_EXTENSION;
        File newPath = new File(getCurrentDirectory() + SAVE_PHOTO_DIRECTORY, saveAs);

        createPhotoFileCopy(originalPhoto, newPath);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        // ... exception handling ...
    }
}

public static String getCurrentDirectory() {
    // ... getting current directory logic ...
}

public void createPhotoFileCopy(BufferedImage originalPhoto, File newPath) throws IOException {
    // ... logging ...
    ImageIO.write(originalPhoto, "png", newPath);
}
----

The logged in member's details are then updated to include this new profile photo.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ChangeProfilePhotoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Logged in member can only change his/her own profile photo.
** Pros: Makes intuitive sense, easy to implement.
** Cons: There is no way for Exco members to ensure that members have appropriate profile photos.
* **Alternative 2**: Exco members can change any member's profile photo.
** Pros: Gives Exco members a way to exercise control over members' profile photos.
** Cons: Implementation becomes more complicated.

===== Aspect: Source files of profile photos

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Make a copy the source image provided to the applications resources.
** Pros: Makes application portable and non-dependent on the rest of the system.
   Members can delete the original file from the computer, without affecting the Club Connect Application.
** Cons: Changes made to the original source images are not reflected in the application.
* **Alternative 2**: Always read the profile photo from the file path provided.
** Pros: Changes made in the source image are reflected in the application.
** Cons: Application becomes highly dependent on the system, in terms of profile photos.
// end::profilephoto[]
// end::profilephoto[]

=== Compress/Decompress Mechanism
==== Current Implementation
Member details are shown as cards in the GUI. Cards can either be decompressed(Figure 22) or compressed(Figure 23).

image::DecompressedMemberCards.png[width="300"]
_Figure 22. Decompressed Member Cards_

image::CompressedCards.png[width="300"]
_Figure 23. Compressed Member Cards_

The `MemberCard` class provides an abstraction for the member card shown in the GUI. By default, it shows a member card that is decompressed.
To differentiate between compressed and decompressed member card, we introduced a `CompressedMemberCard` class. This class extends `MemberCard` (Figure 24) since a `CompressedMemberCard` is a `MemberCard`.
Each of these classes contain a different static String showing location of the actual `FXML` file that determines layout of the member card, hence we get different layouts.

image::MemberCardClassDiagram.png[width="300"]
_Figure 24. `MemberCard` class diagram_

The `compress` and `decompress` commands allows members to select whether they want to see detailed information of members or see a compressed version for easy viewing.
These commands do not extend from `UndoableCommand` but just from `Command` since they do not change the state of the club book.

Due to the similar nature of the `compress` and `decompress` commands, only the `compress` command will be discussed.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The member cards would be decompressed (Figure 22).

The user inputs 'compress' and the sequence diagram (Figure 24) below shows how the different components interact.

_Figure 25. Sequence diagram for compress command to Events Center_

Then, the `MemberListPanel`, which contains the `MemberCard` objects will handle the event (Figure 25). If the cards are already compressed, no changes occur.
However, if the cards are decompressed, the `MemberCard` objects would be converted to `CompressedMemberCard` objects.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to interact from Logic to Ui
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use Event-Driven approach to interact from `CompressCommand`/`DecompressCommand` to `MemberListPanel`
** Pros: Reduces coupling.
** Cons: Slower than just directly changing the `Ui` since a seperate class(`EventsCenter`) has to manage interactions, not
just for compress/decompress but for other events as well.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep a `Ui` attribute in every command just like `Model`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Increases coupling

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings in Figure 19 below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one.
The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.club.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.club.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.club.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.club.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects.
See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged.
See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/club/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Club Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time.
Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components.
<<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command.
Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words.
Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all members in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a member, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each member, and remove the `tag` from each member.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last member in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside member cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow as shown in Figure 21.

+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of members when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of members whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of members status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a member specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first member to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first member.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each member later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the member will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `clubBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsClubBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/member/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the member that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a member.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

[appendix]
== Product Scope

Club Connect is targeted at Student Organizations, such as clubs and societies, that are characterized by a well-established hierarchy.
Student organizations can have hundreds of members, who are divided into sub-committees that have narrower focuses. These subcommittee members are often assigned individual and group tasks. With time, it becomes very difficult to keep track of everything manually.
This is why these organizations require a system for enrolling members, delegating tasks, organising events, and opening polls and getting feedback.
Club Connect provides student organisations with a one-stop shop for all their managerial and organisation needs.

*Target user profile*:

* <<exco-member,Exco member>> of a <<club,Club>>
* <<member,Member>> of a club

*Value proposition*: clubs can efficiently manage its activities and members faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application

*Feature Contribution:*

1. Yash Chowdhary

* Major Feature: Task Management
+
Each member of a student club / organization is responsible for carrying out tasks that are assigned to him/her. Managing tasks encompasses adding tasks or maintaining a To-Do List for yourself, being assigned tasks by Exco members, removing a task from the list once it has been completed, and updating a task's status. This ensures transparency and accountability of the club.

* Minor Feature: Email Command
+
Every student club / organisation makes use of email blasts to communicate with its members. Whether it is for general communication or for club-related events, the ability to email members is essential to the smooth functioning of an organization.

2. Amrut Prabhu

* Major Feature: Importing and Exporting Members List
+
After recruitment events like SLF at NUS or other situations in which details of incoming members are recorded on an Excel sheet, the data can be imported from the Club Connect application instead of manually adding all the members.
The list of members from the Club Connect application can be exported to formats such as .csv or .txt so that the club members can have access to a readable and sharable version of the member list outside the Club Connect application.

* Minor Feature: Add a profile photo
+
All the members of a club are not known by each other, which is especially the case in larger clubs.
Adding a profile photo makes it easier to know what other members look like and to differentiate between members with similar names.

3. Muhammad Nur Kamal Bin Mohammed Ariff

* Major Feature: Polling system
