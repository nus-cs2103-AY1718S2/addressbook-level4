== Introduction
// comment: add a logo for flashy?
Flashy, lightning fast flashcard management.
// comment: better one liners?
[TIP]
====
What are flashcards? Traditionally physical flashcards are actual cards that people use to help memorise things.
The front will have a question prompt and the back will have an answer.
====
// comment: Other ways to explain flashcard?
Physical cards are bulky and hard to search for. They are also very difficult to organise. Flashy is the result of our desire to eliminate these challenges that arise from the use of conventional flashcards. Flashy helps you organise your flashcards using its *tagging* system. By associating flashcards to different tags, Flashy is able to retrieve all flashcards of a given tag in a flash.

Studies have shown that *spaced repetition* is far more effective than regular studying.
And thus we gave Flashy an intelligent scheduler to help space out your study sessions and make them more effective.
// comment: do we want to add Italisization for Flashy?
// comment: how do we reference special words like spaced repetition?

Although Flashy is best suited for language learners,
it is able to handle thousands of cards. Therefore, Flahsy should prove useful for any student hoping to improve their flashcard organisation.

Flashy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Fast typists will find that Flashy can get their flashcard management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

.  Here are some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tags and cards
* **`addc`**`f/Front b/Back t/tag1 t/tag2` : adds a flashcard with front as `Front` and back as `Back`, tagged with `tag1` and `tag2`.
* **`deletec`**`3` : deletes the 3rd flashcard in the visible list
* *`exit` or `quit`* : exits the application

Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
In Flashy, there are three different kinds of flashcards: normal, MCQ and fill-in-the-blanks. +
Normal flashcards are simple question and answer cards with the question being at the front and answer at the back. +
Fill-in-the-blanks flashcards are similar to normal flashcards, just that the question has blanks to prompt the users, and the back of the card has answers to the blanks. +
MCQ flashcards allows you to provide different options as the answer, similar to an MCQ question, and the back will have the number for which option is the correct one.

In Flashy, flashcards are organised with tags. Tags are used to filter down the card list to a relevant subject. For example, a student studying multiple subjects can create tags for each subject.

Cards can have multiple tags.

=== Managing Cards
==== Adding a flashcard: `addc`

Adds a flashcard to Flashy. The presence of `o/OPTION` parameters will determine whether it is a normal or MCQ-type flashcard. +
Format: `addc f/FRONT b/BACK t/TAG` or +
`addc f/FRONT o/OPTION o/OPTION .. b/BACK t/TAG`

Examples:

* `addc f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy t/Trivia` +
Adds a normal flashcard with the front and back of the first card being `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively, as well as tagging it as `Trivia`.
* `addc f/A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles. b/equal, right` +
Adds a fill-blanks card with the front and back of the card being `A square is a polygon with _ side meeting at _ angles.` and `equal, right` respectively. +
Note that a blank is denoted by a single underscore `_`. +
* `addc f/Which continent is Singapore in? o/Asia o/Africa o/Australia o/South America b/1` +
Adds a MCQ-type flashcard with the front being `Which continent is Singapore in?`, options includes `Asia`, `Africa`, `Australia` and `South America` and back being `1`.

[TIP]
A flashcard can have any number of tags (including 0).
[CAUTION]
Ensure that the parameter for `b/` falls between 1 the number of options inclusive.
[CAUTION]
Ensure that if there are blanks, the parameter for `b/` should have the same number of answers (separated by `,`) as there are blanks.

==== Editing a flashcard : `editc`

Edits an existing flashcard currently stored in Flashy. +
Format: `editc INDEX [f/FRONT] [o/OPTION] .. [b/BACK]`

****
* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last card listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* This only applies to parameters which you have supplied. If, for example, no parameters for `f/` are supplied, the front of the card would not be edited.
* A particular type of flashcard (normal, MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks) can only be edited to the same type of flashcard (i.e. you cannot edit a normal flashcard to a MCQ flashcard).
****

Examples:

* `editc 1 f/What is the greatest flashcard application? b/Flashy` +
Edits the front and back of the 1st flashcard to be `What is the greatest flashcard application?` and `Flashy` respectively.
* `editc 2 b/Lee Hsien Loong` +
Edits the back of the 2nd flashcard to be `Lee Hsien Loong`.
* `editc 1 o/Asia o/Australia o/Africa` +
Edits the options of the 1st flashcard to be `Asia`, `Australia` and `Africa`. (Only if that flashcard is a MCQ flashcard).

[CAUTION]
Ensure that the constraints on flashcard is not violated when editing. For constraints, refer to the *Caution* warning under Section 4.1.1: Adding a flashcard.

==== Deleting a flashcard : `deletec`

Deletes the specified flashcard. +
Format: `deletec INDEX`

****
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

`deletec 2` +
Deletes the 2nd flashcard in the list.


=== Managing Tags
==== Selecting a tag : `select`

Selects the tag identified by the index number. This will show only flashcards with the tag selected. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `select 2` +
Selects the 2nd tag in the list.
* `select 1` +
Selects the 1st tag in the list.

==== Filtering tags: `find`

Filters the tag list to contain those that match the search terms. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====
The search is case-insensitive, and finds exact partial matches to the tag name. For example, `bio` would match `Biology`.
====

Examples:

* `find biology` will show only tags matching the word `biology`. This will match `Biology`, `biology`, and `Biology Midterms`, and not `bio`, or `chemistry`.

==== Editing a tag : `edit`

Updates an existing tag to the specified values. +
Format: `edit INDEX t/TAG c/COLOR`

****
* Edits the tag at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the current tag listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Color must be a string of length 6 specifying a link:https://htmlcolorcodes.com/[hex color code]. For example, the color white is represented as `FFFFFF`.
* The existing name of the tag will be replaced with the value that was entered.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 t/French` +
Changes the name of the first tag in the list to `French`.
* `edit 2 t/German c/FF5733` +
Changes the name of the second tag in the list to `German` and the color of the tag to a shade of orange.

==== Deleting a Tag: `delete`

Deletes an existing tag. This will remove the tag from all cards that have the tag.

Examples:

* `delete 1` deletes the first visible tag.
* `delete 2` deletes the second visible tag.

=== Using flashcard
After adding and managing your flashcards, its time to get your A+!
This section will teach you how to let Flashy's intelligent scheduling algorithm prompt you the best time to study!

==== Showing a flashcard : `showDue`

Reveals the answer of the flashcard identified by the index number used in the list. +
Format: `show INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `show 2` +
Shows the 2nd flashcard in the list.
* `show 1` +
Shows the 1st flashcard in the list.

==== Answering flashcards: `Answer`
Answer to give feedback to the scheduling algorithm to schedule the cards for future review.

Format: `schedule CONFIDENCE`

****
* The confidence can only be 0, 1, 2.
* `show` cammand must be used first before `schedule` can be used.
****

There are 3 `CONFIDENCE` levels

* `answer 0` +
Go again. I don't know the answer to this card. Card will then be requeued into the same session again.
* `answer 1` +
Pass. I kind of know the answer, but need more practice. Card will then be scheduled for the near future. To get more practice.
* `answer 2` +
Easy A+. Card will then be scheduled further into the future. Other cards need more review than this one.

[TIP]
====
This gives feedback to the scheduler algorithm to automatically schedule the card for review at a time when it thinks you are likely to forget it.

This design is based off the well known forgetting curve, you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve
====

Examples:

* `schedule 1` +
Card will be resheduled into near future.

==== Show flashcards for review: `Schedule`
Lists and show flashcards due for review today.

Format: `Today`

Example:

* `Today`

Lists and show flashcards due for review today.
