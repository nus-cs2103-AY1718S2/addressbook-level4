== PROJECT: AddSurance

---

== Overview

AddSurance is a comprehensive, reliable and convenient address book for insurance agents built on a simple belief — 
efficiency and elegance. With its minimalistic design, user interactions are greatly simplified using a CLI
(Command Line Interface). With this application, you can maintain your huge list of contacts easily, at the same time,
 managing your schedule efficiently. So, if you are a reasonably tech-savvy insurance agent, this application is absolutely designed for you!

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to email people with email templates*
** What it does: Emails contacts in AddSurance a specified template.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user has to email a lot of people for various reasons. With this feature,
the user will not need to manually email all his contacts and retype his emails.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of the design pattern adopted by AddSurance. The implementation too was challenging
 as it required affecting various models and going up and down different levels of abstraction.
** Credits: _The actual SMTP handling was done through an api from GMail_

* *Minor enhancement*: Modified find command to search across attributes, including tags and address and phone number.
