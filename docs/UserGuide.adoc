== Introduction

Part-Time Manager (PTMan) is an application made for companies to manage their part-timers and their respective working schedules.
PTMan allows managers to easily schedule work shifts and keep track of their employees' information.
It also allows the part-timers to have the flexibility of choosing their own working schedules by applying for the available shifts.
The primary mode of interaction with PTMan is via keyboard commands, so if you are a proficient typist, then you will feel right at home using PTMan!
 +

This user guide comes with comprehensive instructions and examples of the various features to help you get started.
Sounds great? Jump straight to <<Quick Start, Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Here are the steps required to get PTMan up and running on your computer:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `PTMan.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PTMan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The graphical user interface (GUI) as seen in _<<fig-Startup>>_ should appear in a few seconds.
+
[[fig-Startup]]

image::Ui.png[width="790"]
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

[NOTE]
You may refer to <<Commands>> for more details of the available commands.

[IMPORTANT]
If you are a manager, you have access to <<Admin Mode, admin mode>>. Admin mode allows you to access all the <<Manager Commands, manager commands>>.
To prevent unauthorised access, please change your default admin mode password using the `changeadminpw` command.
You may refer to <<Cap>> for instructions on how to do so.

[[Features]]
== Features
In this section, you will be introduced to the various features of PTMan.

=== User Authentication
PTMan has user authentication for both managers and employees to prevent unauthorised execution of <<Commands, commands>>.

Managers can refer to <<Admin mode>> for admin authentication, while employees can refer to <<Employee password>> for employee authentication.

==== Admin mode
For managers, admin mode allows you to access all the <<Manager Commands, manager commands>> in PTMan.
To enter admin mode, please refer to <<Logging in to admin mode: `login`>>.
// TODO: SCREENSHOT
[NOTE]
The default admin password is `DEFAULT1`.

[IMPORTANT]
It is crucial to change the default admin password to prevent unauthorised access to admin mode.
You may refer to <<Cap>> for instructions on how to do so.

==== Employee password
For employees, your employee password identifies you and authorizes you to execute <<Employee Commands, employee commands>>.
It ensures that you are unable to, for example, <<Applying for a shift: `apply`, `apply`>> someone else for a shift without knowing their password.

[NOTE]
The default employee password is `DEFAULT1`.

[IMPORTANT]
It is crucial to change the default employee password to prevent unauthorised execution of employee commands.
You may refer to <<Changing your employee password: `changepw`>> for instructions on how to do so.

// tag::outletManagement[]
=== Outlet Management
If you are a manager, PTMan allows you to manage your outlet. You can edit your outlet name, operating hours, contact number and email.
The timetable automatically re-sizes according to the operating hours. You can also create announcements to broadcast to your employees.
Moreover, PTMan allows you to encrypt and decrypt data stored locally to prevent unauthorised users from interpreting and understanding essential and private data.

If you are an employee, you can view announcements created by your manager and take actions accordingly.

_<<fig-Feature_Outlet>>_ shows the Outlet Display where you can view your outlet information.

[[fig-Feature_Outlet]]
.Sample Outlet Information Displayed +
image::IntroductionToOutlet.jpg[width="790"]
// end::outletManagement[]

=== Shift Management
If you are a manager, PTMan allows you to manage your employees' work shifts.
You can add shifts, remove shifts and decide which employees are working at each shift.
This can significantly reduce your paperwork related to employee scheduling.

If you are an employee, PTMan gives you flexibility in your working hours by allowing you to apply for shifts that you wish to work in.

Shifts that are in PTMan can be viewed via the <<Timetable, timetable>>.

// tag::timetableIntro[]
=== Timetable
PTMan has a timetable that displays all the shifts in a weekly format. There are many interactions between the
timetable and you, as a user, so this section aims to familiarise you with the timetable.

==== Shift colours

The shifts in PTMan are colour-coded, and here is what the different colours mean:

* *Green*: Shift is available with multiple slots left.
* *Yellow*: Shift is available, but slots are running out.
* *Red*: Shift is no longer available, all slots for the shift have run out.
* *Blue*: Shift is taken up by currently selected employee.
* *Brown*: Shift is not taken up by currently selected employee.

_<<fig-Feature_Timetable1>>_ below shows how the timetable looks like in a sample PTMan app. +
 +
[[fig-Feature_Timetable1]]
.A Sample Timetable with Shifts +
image::Feature_Timetable1.png[width="790"]

PTMan also allows employees to view their own shifts using the <<Displaying an employeeâ€™s shifts on the timetable: `select`, `select`>> command.
_<<fig-Feature_Timetable2>>_ shows how the timetable look like in a sample PTMan app when an employee is selected.
 +
[[fig-Feature_Timetable2]]
.A Sample Timetable with Shifts after `select` +
image::Feature_Timetable2.png[width="790"]

==== Timetable navigation

There are two ways to navigate through the different weeks in the timetable:

. Using Keyboard Shortcuts
+
* For Windows:
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&rarr;] : Navigates timetable to the next week.
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&larr;] : Navigates timetable to the previous week.
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&darr;] : Navigates timetable to the current week.
* For Mac:
** kbd:[Command] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&rarr;] : Navigates timetable to the next week.
** kbd:[Command] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&larr;] : Navigates timetable to the previous week.
** kbd:[Command] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[&darr;] : Navigates timetable to the current week.
. Using Mouse Clicks
+
* At the top of the timetable, there is a navigation bar with two arrow buttons which you can click on.
These buttons `<` and `>` navigates the timetable to the previous and next week respectively.
_<<fig-Feature_Timetable3>>_ below shows the navigation bar, with the two arrow buttons circled. +

=== Saving the Data

All the data is saved in the hard disk automatically upon execution of any command that changes the data. There is no need to manually save your changes.

// tag::backup[]
=== Backing Up the Data
Backup files are automatically created and saved in the hard disk upon exiting the app. There is no need to do backup manually. +
Following these steps, you can replace your corrupted local storage files with the backup files:

. Copy the backup files named `outletinformation.xml.backup` and `parttimemanager.xml.backup`.
. Open the folder where you store `PTMan.jar`.
. Open the `data` folder.
. Paste your copied backup files in this `data` folder.
. Rename `outletinformation.xml.backup` to `outletinformation.xml`.
. Rename `parttimemanager.xml.backup` to `parttimemanager.xml`.
. Run the app `PTMan.jar` and you will see all the restored data read from backup files.
// end::backup[]

=== Keeping Track of Employees' Monthly Salaries [Coming in v2.0]

If you are a manager, PTMan will help you keep track of your employees' monthly salaries.
PTMan do so by calculating the number of hours each employee has worked based on the shifts that they applied for throughout the month.

=== Saving Data to the Cloud [Coming in v2.0]

Currently, PTMan is meant to be used on a single shared device as it is limited by local storage.
By saving PTMan's data to the cloud, both employees and managers can access PTMan from their own devices since data can now be shared.

== Commands
The main method of user interaction with PTMan is via keyboard commands.
Commands are split into 3 sub-sections, <<Manager Commands, Manager Commands>>, <<Employee Commands, Employee Commands>>, and <<General Commands, General Commands>>. +

Take note that for this user guide, our commands will follow the format as stated below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times, or none at all. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For your convenience, many commands have a shorthand. +
eg. `list` and `l` will both show a list of all employees in PTMan.
====

=== Manager Commands
As a manager, you are able to access all commands in this section in addition to the <<General Commands, general commands>>.
