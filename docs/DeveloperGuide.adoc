== Introduction

_{ Introduction to be added. }_

== Setting Up

_{ Preface to be added. }_

=== Prerequisites

Before working on PrioriTask, please install these following requirements:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

After installing all requirements, please do these following steps to setup this project in your computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first) and set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

After setting up the project, you can do these step to verify that all requirements are met and the project is correctly set up.

. Run the `seedu.organizer.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

_{ Preface to be added. }_

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

_{ Preface to be added. }_

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* (refer to Figure 1) given below explains the high-level design of the App.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

Given below is a quick overview of each component. The two main components of the App includes:

. `Main`, with only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

.. Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other at app launch.
.. Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary during shut down.

. <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>, representing a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

.. `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
.. `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Represents the UI of the App
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to Figure 2) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteTask.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `OrganizerChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `OrganizerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Organizer data.
* automatically updates Tasks' priority levels within the Organizer via the UniqueTaskList
* sorts tasks within the Organizer
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/organizer/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Organizer data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.organizer.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the organizer (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Reference from Figure 7.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

===== Scenario

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th task in the organizer. The current state of the organizer is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.UndoRedoStack `delete 5` command execution
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/Study ...` to add a new task.

.UndoRedoStack `add n/Study ...` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the organizer to the state before the `add` command executed.

.UndoRedoStack `undo` command execution
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.UndeRedoStack sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the organizer to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/Study` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.UndoRedoStack `clear` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.UndoRedoStack `list` command execution
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.UndoRedoStack activity diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire organizer.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the organizer (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the organizer and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::taskpriority[]
=== Task's Priority Autoupdating and AutoSorting feature
==== Current Implementation

The autoupdating and autosorting mechanism resides inside `UniqueTaskList`. The `UniqueTaskList` is responsible for updating each Task’s priority level and sorting the `ObservableList<Task>` whenever a new `Task` is added. In addition, whenever a `Task` is edited, the `ObservableList<Task>` is sorted again.

===== Description of `UniqueTaskList` 's `add` method

The `add` method of the `UniqueTaskList` class is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
public void add(Task toAdd) throws DuplicateTaskException {
    //check non null and no duplicate task
    toAdd = updatePriority(toAdd);
    internalList.add(toAdd);
    sortTasks();
}
----

The `updatePriority` method returns a new `Task` with a new `Priority` based on the current date, `AddedDate`, and `Deadline`.

The new `Priority` level will remain within the range of 0 - 9. The new `Priority` is calculated as such :

* If the current date is equal to `AddedDate`
** `Priority` remains the same.
* If the current date is past `Deadline`
** `Priority` is set to the `HIGHEST_SETTABLE_PRIORITY_LEVEL` : 9
* If the current date is before `Deadline` and not equal to `AddedDate`
** `Priority is calculated via the following formula :

[source,java]
----
priorityDifferenceFromMax = HIGHEST_SETTABLE_PRIORITY_LEVEL - currentPriority

dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline = Duration.between(currentDate, deadline)

dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline = Duration.between(dateAdded, deadline)

priorityToIncrease = priorityDifferenceFromMax * ((dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline - dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline) / dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline)

newPriority = currentPriority + priorityToIncrease
----

The new `Task` with its updated `Priority` will then be added to `UniqueTaskList`’s `internalList`. Following that, the `internalList` is sorted via the `sortTasks` method. The `sortTasks` method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void sortTasks() {
    internalList.sort(Task.priorityComparator());
}
----

The `sortTasks` method makes use of the `ObservableList` class’s `sort` method and `Task`’s `priorityComparator` method. The `priorityComparator` method returns a `Comparator` that sorts `Task`’s based on descending `Priority` levels. The `internalList` is sorted with respect to the comparator.

===== Scenario

Consider a `addTask` method call by the `Organizer`. The current date is 2018-03-19.

The following is a sequence diagram which represents the `Organizer` adding a Study `Task`.

.addTask(Study) method execution sequence diagram
image::OrganizerAddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose the `tasks` currently contains the following two `Task` s.

.`tasks` 's initial `Task` s
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram1.png[width="800"]

The following figure represents the "Study" `Task`.

."Study" `Task`
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram2.png[width="300"]

When `tasks` calls `updatePriority(Study)`, the new priority level is calculated as such :

[source,java]
----
priorityDifferenceFromMax = 9 - 0 = 9

dayDifferenceCurrentToDeadline = 14

dayDifferenceAddedToDeadline = 31

priorityToIncrease = 9 * ((31 - 14) / 31) = 4

newPriority = 0 + 4 = 4
----

A new "Study" `Task` is created and added to the `internalList`.

.`internalList` after "Study" `Task` is added
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram3.png[width="800"]

The `sortTasks` method is then called, which calls the `priorityCompartor` method, and uses the `Comparator` returned to sort the `Task` s. This results in the following `UniqueTaskList`.

.`internalList` after `sortTasks` is called
image::OrganizerAddTaskDiagram4.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect : Implementation of `updatePriority`

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Add a new method `updatePriority` in UniqueTaskList’s `add`
** Pros : Convenient to update the priority during this method call; since during initialization of `Organizer`, `add` is called for every `Task` to initialize the `UniqueTaskList`.
** Cons : Possible violation of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `UniqueTaskList` now updates `Task` priorities and stores `Task` s.
* Alternative 2 : Add a new class `UpdatedUniqueTaskList` which extends `UniqueTaskList`
** Pros : Removes violation of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns in Alternative 1.
** Cons : Repeats the logic in `UniqueTaskList` while adding one method.

===== Aspect : How `updatePriority` executes

* Alternative 1 (current choice) : Return a new `Task` with new `Priority`
** Pros : Easy to implement.
** Cons : A new object is created twice during every addition, even if `Priority` is not updated; Hence slightly inefficient.
* Alternative 2 : Edit the `Priority` parameter of the `Task`
** Pros : No new objects need to be created.
** Cons : Requires major overhaul of `Task` and it’s parameters to be mutable.

===== Aspect : Scope of `updatePriority` and `sortTasks`

* Alternative 1 (current choice) : Implement within `Model`
** Pros : No need to deal with commands, and fits with the idea of automation.
** Cons : Concern of updating priorities and sorting tasks may not lie with `Model` but `Logic`.
* Alternative 2 : Implement within `Logic`
** Pros : Fits with the concern of updating priorities and sorting tasks.
** Cons : Requires development of commands and extra command calls to be automatically called upon start of application; unnecessary trouble for same feature.

// end::taskpriority[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
==== Current Implementation

The calendar feature is facilitated by the `Calendar` class, which supports the `CalendarPanel`. The `Calendar` is responsible for displaying a monthly calendar view to the users through the `CalendarPanel`. The following diagram describes the structure of the calendar system:

.UML Class Diagram for Calendar
image::CalendarComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `MonthView` facilitates the drawing of the calendar, while `Calendar` supports the display of the calendar onto the `CalendarPanel`. The `MonthView` interacts very closely with the corresponding FXML file, and the following diagram shows the basic layout of the calendar:

.Basic Calendar Layout
image::MonthViewLayoutDiagram.png[width="800"]

The basic calendar layout (refer to Figure 25) is reflected in the `MonthView.fxml` file, and is loaded by `MonthView`. `MonthView` uses the JavaFX layout objects extensively when drawing the calendar. An example would be the `addMonthDate` method, which adds a particular date to the exact `column` and `row` in the `taskCalendar`. The `addMonthDate` method is implemented as such:

[source,java]
----
private void addMonthDate(Text dateToPrint, int column, int row) {
    taskCalendar.add(dateToPrint, column, row);
    taskCalendar.setHalignment(dateToPrint, HPos.LEFT);
    taskCalendar.setValignment(dateToPrint, VPos.TOP)
}
----

Both the `Calendar` and `CalendarPanel` use the JavaFX `StackPane` object as a placeholder for the `MonthView`. After loading the respective FXML files, methods in the `Calendar` and `CalendarPanel` fetch the display for the `MonthView` as such:

[source,java]
----
public void getCurrentMonth(YearMonth currentYearMonth) throws IOException {
    // draws the calendar for the current month
    calendarPlaceholder.getChildren().add(monthView.getRoot());
}

private void createMainView() throws IOException {
    // fetches the calendar view
    calendarPane.getChildren().add(calendar.getRoot());
}
----

// end::calendar[]

// tag::subtask[]
=== Subtask
==== Current Implementation

Subtask feature allows user to split their tasks into multiple subtasks. This feature allows user to better
manage their task. It is implemented using `Subtask` class and `UniqueSubtaskList` class as shown by the diagram below:

.Subtask UML Class Diagram
image::SubtaskComponentDiagram.png[width="800"]

`UniqueSubtaskList` is created to ensure that no task have a duplicated subtask.

*Subtask management*

To manage the subtasks (Add, edit, etc), the task should be copied since `Task` is immutable.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Implementation of `Subtask`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Add a new class `Subtask`
** Pros: Better isolation and easier modification to `Subtask` if needed.
** Cons: Restricted the possibility of having a subtask that have subtasks.

* **Alternative 2:** Use current `Task` class
** Pros: Easier to implement and subtask will share the same properties with `Task`.
** Cons: Possibility of having a cyclic subtask (a task that also a subtask of it self) if not handled carefully.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UniqueSubtaskList`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Use `List` to store subtasks.
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: Performance issue will appear when that data is large. Since any operation in `UniqueSubtaskList` except lookup
is `O(n)`

* **Alternative 2:** Use a combination of BBST and LinkedList to store subtasks.
** Pros: Faster that the first alternative since it only took `O(log n)` to do every operation.
** Cons: Harder to implement and more robust testing is required since it is more bug prone than the first alternative.

The second alternative is planned to be implemented in the near future.

// end::subtask[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.organizer.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.organizer.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
