By: `Huat Ah Finance Pte Ltd`      Since: `Feb 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

If you:

* are a 21st Century modern loan shark boss,
* prefer to use a desktop app for managing operations,
* prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
* can type fast and prefer a keyboard as your main input method,

HuatAh! can get your operations management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `HuatAh.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  If you still feel unfamiliar with the commands, you may make use of the Menu at the top of the application.
The various menu items have keyboard shortcuts that can be used to speed up your workflow as well!
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`ty: c n: John Doe p: 98765432 e: johnd@example.com a: John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a `Customer` named `John Doe` to the database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the third contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the application

//@@author melvintzw
== Known Issues
* Default date is January 1, 1970 (default Java Date value), when no start date or due date
is specified when adding a customer.

== Command Summary
[NOTE]
====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n: NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n: John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n: NAME [t: TAG]` can be used as `n: John Doe t: friend` or as `n: John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t: TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t: friend`, `t: friend t: family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n: NAME p: PHONE_NUMBER`, `p: PHONE_NUMBER n: NAME` is also acceptable.
