== PROJECT: Club Connect

== 1. Overview

https://github.com/amrut-prabhu/club-connect[*Club Connect*] is a computer application targeted at student club members at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.
It provides all members of the club with the ability to browse through profiles of other members, participate in polls,
and manage club-related tasks.

Since Club Connect is targeted at those who prefer using the keyboard over a mouse, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) for input.
However, all the output is displayed in a traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) -
which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

You can see more details about the project https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main[here] and get the latest release https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/releases[here].

== 2. About this portfolio

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the *Club Connect* project.
It includes a summary of features that I implemented and other contributions to the project.
Some extracts of my documentation in the Club Connect https://cs2103jan2018-w15-b4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[User Guide] and https://cs2103jan2018-w15-b4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html[Developer Guide] are also included.

== 3. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: This enhancement added functionality to *manage information of club members*.
** What it does: The import feature adds all members in a specified CSV (comma separated values) file to Club Connect.
                Conversely, the export feature makes it possible to add the details of all members in Club Connect to a CSV file.
** Justification: During recruitment events (such as the annual Student Life Fair at the National University of Singapore),
                  club representatives collect data of prospective members using software like Microsoft Excel.
                  They will then have to update Club Connect's database to include the data of the inducted members.
                  The `import` command allows Executive Committee (Exco) members to add all these new members in one go. +
                   +
                  For club administration tasks where you need to get a list of all members of the club and their details
                  (signing up all members to NUSync, for example), the `export` command comes in handy.
                  It generates a file containing all the relevant information in a user friendly form.
                  This information can then be easily managed and modified outside the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of almost all components of the software.
                Though the implementation of these features is intuitive and makes use of existing code wherever possible,
                it was challenging as it required the creation of a CsvUtil class (to handle parsing) from scratch.
                It is also made robust in order to prevent frustration in users.
** Relevant pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/pull/126[#126] and https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/pull/155[#155],

* *Minor enhancement*: This enhancement added support for a profile photo for each member.
** What it does: This enhancement allows the logged in members to change their profile photo.
                Similarly, they can choose to remove their profile photo as well.
** Justification: Since most student clubs have a large number of members, members may find it difficult to identify others by name alone.
                  Having the ability to add a profile photo for yourself makes it much easier for others to identify you when they need to contact you.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of almost all components of the software, from `Storage` to `Ui`.
                It was challenging as the feature had to handle the reading and writing of image files efficiently, and had to allow the application to remain portable.
