== Introduction

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

Currently, Club Connect is a computer application that makes use of a *Command Line Interface* (<<DeveloperGuide#cli,CLI>>) for increased productivity, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
So, you can have increased productivity (owing to the CLI) without having to give up the beauty and aesthetics of a traditional GUI application.

The faster you type, the faster Club Connect gets your club-management tasks done.

== Features

This section describes the various features that Club Connect puts at your disposal.

This is how you should interpret the commands in this user guide.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/President` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Treasurer`, `t/Captain t/Goalkeeper` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

== Tips

Not satisfied with your productivity while using Club Connect?
Can't remember the command names?
Here are some tips and tricks:

* *Transferring data to another computer* +
Install the Club Connect app on the other computer.
Then, overwrite the empty data file it creates (`clubbook.xml`) with the data file from your previous `Club Connect` folder.

* *Alternative command names*
If you do not like the default command name or feel that it is too long, you can use one of its aliases to execute the command instead.
+
Example: The `changepic` command uses `pic` as an alias.
So, both commands shown below can be used change your profile picture to the "john_doe.jpg" image on John Doe's Desktop. +
`changepic C:/Users/John Doe/Desktop/john_doe.jpg`
+
`pic C:/Users/John Doe/Desktop/john_doe.jpg` +

[[csv-data-format]]
* *CSV format for `import`* +
In order to successfully import data of members from the specified file, it has to follow the format shown in <<csv-format,Figure 3>>.
+
[[csv-format]]
.Required format of data in the file
image::CSV_format.png[height="350"]
+
The columns in the import file should be in the same order as shown in the figure above.
All the tags of a member should be in a single cell, separated by commas (",").
Also, to successfully import the data of a member, you have to make sure that their details conform to the constraints of the <<add-command,`add` command>>.

// end::tips[]

== Coming in v2.0

* *Encrypt data files* : `encrypt` +
Encryption is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and others cannot.  +
By encrypting Club Connect's data files, you can ensure that others will not be able to read members' information if they open the files. Do note, however, that this may slightly affect performance.

* *Chat with any member* : `chat INDEX` +
You can message other members in real time without ever needing to leave the Club Connect application.

* *Group Chats* : `gchat GROUP_NAME` +
Tired of sending the same message to multiple members? The *Group Chat* feature allows you to have conversations as a group so that everyone is kept in the loop.

* *Submit anonymous feedback* : `feedback` +
Not satisfied with certain aspects of the club? Afraid to speak up? +
Fret not, Club Connect provides you with a platform to voice your opinions. And yes, we guarantee your anonymity.
