== Introduction

CoinBook is a desktop application that is made for users who prefer to work on a mouse-free, command line platform with minimal graphical user interface (GUI) support.
Our program allows you to store a portfolio of your cryptocurrency purchases as well as track the latest price trends and news, in addition to allowing for many
operations to simplify and expedite your management process such as profit calculation.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CoinBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all Coins
* **`add`**`n/BTC a/100` : adds a Coin account named `BTC` to the CoinBook with an initial amount of 100 coins.
* **`buy`**`BTC 3` : adds 3 coins into the BTC account.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Alternatively, you can type replace commands by their aliases which are shorter to achieve the same effect. For example:

* *`l`* : lists all accounts

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. Command aliases are specified after the `/` symbol.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/ETH`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/BTC t/fav` or as `n/BTC`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cheap`, `t/active t/fav` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/VALUE`, `a/VALUE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Items in curly braces indicate multiple possibilities. e.g. `buy {NAME, TAG} AMOUNT`, is a command where the first parameter can either be a NAME or a TAG. +
    [!] Bear in mind that if multiple items are tagged, then the command will be applied to all accounts under the same tag.
