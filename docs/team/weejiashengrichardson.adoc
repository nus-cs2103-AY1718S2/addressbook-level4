== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to archive closed job entries* and *the ability to analyse job entries*
** What it does: allows the user to archive closed job entries within the specified date range and analyse the job entries within the current month.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: sorting the employee list alphabetically according to their names.
