== PROJECT: reInsurance

---

== Overview

reInsurance is customer relationship management software that aims to help insurance agents better manage their clients.
It is based AddressBook - Level 4 a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to secure the application via passwords and data encryption *
** What it does: allows the user to set a password for the application and ensures that the client's data is encrypted
** Justification: Data should not be stored in plaintext. Encrypting the data improves the product significantly because reInsurance contains sensitive client's information and commissions earned from clients so only the user should be able to view the contents.
The implementation of a passwords not only provided a layer of security but a means to prove the identity of the user.
** Highlights: This feature added a layer of security to the application which was non-existent.
Data encryption affects how data is stored. The implementation of a password requires an extensive analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation was challenging as it requires changes to how the application is launched.
** Credits: Made references from CS2103AUG2017-F11-B1 for password implementation

* *Minor enhancement*: added a sort command that allows users to sort clients according to their names in lexicographical order
* *Minor enhancement*: added a Group attribute that allows users to group their clients and sort them according to groups
