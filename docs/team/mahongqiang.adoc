== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to filter persons*
** What it does: allows the user to filter persons according to fields like cGPA, expected graduation year, rating and interview date.
** Justification: This feature boosts the productivity significantly because a user can easily find out people in mind. For example, the user can `filter y/2019` to obtain all students graduating next year.
** Highlights: This enhancement builds upon the fields a person has. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required multiple new predicate and utility classes.
** Credits:

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Adds a status field and status command that updates the field
** Adds a expected graduation year field and modify add and edit command to accommodate such changes
** Adds a resume field
** Copies resume and profile pic to `data` folder for easy migration purpose
