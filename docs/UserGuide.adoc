== Introduction

Catalogue is for *NUS students* who prefer to use a desktop app for finding, borrowing and returning books at the Central Library
Catalogue is for *NUS librarian* who prefer to use a desktop app for managing books, students accounts and loans at the Central Library.
More importantly, Catalogue is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Catalogue can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
This guide will help you and give you an overview of the different features of Catalogue.
