== Introduction

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

Currently, Club Connect is a computer application that makes use of a *Command Line Interface* (<<DeveloperGuide#cli,CLI>>) for increased productivity, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
So, you can have increased productivity (owing to the CLI) without having to give up the beauty and aesthetics of a traditional GUI application.

The faster you type, the faster Club Connect gets your club-management tasks done.

== Features

This section describes the various features that Club Connect puts at your disposal.

This is how you should interpret the commands in this user guide.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/President` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Treasurer`, `t/Captain t/Goalkeeper` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

Can't remember the command names?
Here are some tips and tricks:

* *Data transfer to another computer* +
. Install the Club Connect app on the other computer.
. Overwrite the empty data file it creates (`clubbook.xml`) with the data file from your previous `Club Connect` folder.

* *Alternative command names* +
If you do not like the default command name or feel that it is too long, you can use one of its aliases to execute the command instead.
+
Example: The `changepic` command uses `pic` as an alias.
So, both commands shown below can be used change your profile picture to the "john_doe.jpg" image on John Doe's Desktop. +
`changepic C:/Users/John Doe/Desktop/john_doe.jpg`
+
`pic C:/Users/John Doe/Desktop/john_doe.jpg` +

image::CSV_format.png[height="350"]
+
The columns in the import file should be in the same order as shown in the figure above.
All the tags of a member should be in a single cell, separated by commas (",").
Also, to successfully import the data of a member, you have to make sure that their details conform to the <<constraints, constraints>>.

You can message other members in real time without ever needing to leave the Club Connect application.
