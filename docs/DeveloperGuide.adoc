== Introduction

ProgressChecker is for *students* who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of their learning progressthroughout the certain module. (Current version is available for CS2103/T) +

For the current version, you can add your teammates details into ProgressChecker. You can also create a new task list through google task. By default, app will display all the link:DeveloperGuide.adoc#Learning-Outcomes[Learning Outcomes] taken from the https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/website/index.html[CS2103/T module website] for this week in the task list. Students can use this task list to track their weekly homework and the progress of the project.

More importantly, ProgressChecker is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:DeveloperGuide.adoc#GUI[GUI]).
If you can type fast, ProgressChecker can get your learning outcome tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

Now you are ready to jump to the <<Setting-up,Setting up>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Icons Meaning
You will be seeing these icons throughout the guide. Each icon display specific information.

[TIP]
This lightbulb icon means tips that you can try when using ProgressChecker.

[NOTE]
This info icon means notes that you should pay attention to when using ProgressChecker.

== Setting up

There are some things you will need to set up before getting started in contributing to ProgressChecker. Below lists the important key elements you will have to configure.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow[Fork] this repo, and https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/website/book/gitAndGithub/init/index.html[clone] the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
... Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
image:setup2.png[width="600"] +
_step 3.i_
... Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK` +
image:setup3.png[width="600"]  +
_step 5_
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
image:setup5.png[width="600"]  +
_step 8_

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `gradlew.bat run` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-T09-B3/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-T09-B3/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Now you are ready to start coding! You can:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture,Design Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]

ProgressChecker consists of multiple components that work together via an event-driven structure. This section will break down the various components in details to help you jump straight into understanding the architecture in depth.

=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
{sp} +
[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

{sp} +

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for: +

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other at app launch.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ProgressCheckerChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

{sp} +

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

{sp} +

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

{sp} +

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]

{sp}+

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ProgressCheckerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a teammate) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.progresschecker.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the ProgressChecker (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the ProgressChecker before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th teammate in the ProgressChecker. The current state of the ProgressChecker is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Undo/Redo Stack at Starting Point
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new teammate.

.Undo/Redo Stack with New Command `add`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the teammate was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the ProgressChecker to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Undo/Redo Stack with Command `undo`
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram of Undo/Redo
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the ProgressChecker to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Undo/Redo Stack with New Command `clear`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Undo/Redo Stack with Command `list`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`** +
(current choice)
|We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
|Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

|**Override `execute()`**
|Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
|Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

|===

{sp}+

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Save the entire ProgressChecker** +
(current choice)
|Easy to implement.
|May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

|**Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself**
|Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the teammate being deleted).
|We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Only include commands that modifies the ProgressChecker (`add`, `clear`, `edit`)** +
(current choice)
|We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
|User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.

|**Include all commands**
|Might be more intuitive for the user.
| User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the ProgressChecker and not the view.

|===

[NOTE]
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

{sp} +

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**Use separate stack for undo and redo** +
(current choice)
|Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
|Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.

|**Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo**
|We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
|Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

|===

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::upload[]
=== Upload feature
==== Planned Implementation

The Upload command will allow users to upload their preferred image to replace the default profile photo.

The valid photo to be upload will be copies from local path inside resources folder under /images/contact. The name of the file will be renamed according to the time that the photo is uploaded.

Upload can be undoable. The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to `uploadPhoto` event.

.Component Interactions for `uploadPhoto` Command
image::SDforUploadPhoto.png[width="800"]

{sp} +

UploadCommand is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class UploadCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(personToUpdate);
        try {
            model.addPhoto(photoPath);
            model.uploadPhoto(personToUpdate, savePath);
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be missing");
        } catch (DuplicatePhotoException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_IMAGE_DUPLICATE);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_IMAGE_DUPLICATE);
        }
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
Users are allowed to reload the image if they want to update the profile photo.

Here is the code to copy the photo from local path inside resources folder.
[source,java]
----
public String copyLocalPhoto(String localPath) throws IOException {
    File localFile = new File(localPath);
    String newPath = createSavePath(localPath);
    if (!localFile.exists()) {
        throw new FileNotFoundException(MESSAGE_LOCAL_PATH_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    createSavedPhoto(newPath);
    try {
        copyFile(localPath, newPath);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException(MESSAGE_COPY_FAIL);
    }
    return newPath;
}
----

[NOTE]
If the local path is invalid or the image cannot be found, the upload will not be successful. The extension of the file can only be 'jpg', 'jpeg' or 'png'. User will be asked to write the correct path to image again.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UploadCommand`

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**User will provide the path of image** +
(current choice)
|The path can be used directly to find the image and display it in the app.
|Image may be a local file. When other users open the app, they cannot see the update.

|**User will upload image into our github folder manually**
|Everyone can see the update of profile photo.
|Quite trobulesome to upload photo manually first.

|===
// end::upload[]

// tag::search[]
=== Dynamic Search Implementation
==== Current Implementation

The `find` command shows the searched contact currently. However, the user does not need to type the complete name press enter, the whole search is dynamic. As soon as the user types the command `find` dynamic search state is toggled. After typing `find` command, whichever character is entered by the user, the results which contain
 the typed keywords appear.

The following diagram shows the UML diagram for `find` command :

.UML Diagram of `find` Command
image::FindCommandUMLDiagram.png[width="120"]

To implement the dynamic search, we used the following method - as soon as the user enters any character in the command box, the text is retrieved from
the command box and checked if it is the `find` command. If it is the `find` command, dynamic search is started. After the `find` command is detected in the
command box, every key that is pressed is parsed and sent to the `find` command parser. After that the basic functionality of find is used and the results are displayed.

The code snippet for the implementation is:
[source,java]
----
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
        switch (keyEvent.getCode()) {
        // .. other keypress logic ..
        default:
            try {
                if (// .. checking if the text is `find` command) {
                    isCorrectCommandWord = !commandTextField.getText().trim().isEmpty();
                    CommandResult commandResult;
                    if (keyEvent.getCode() != KeyCode.BACK_SPACE && keyEvent.getCode() != KeyCode.DELETE) {
                        commandResult = logic.execute(commandTextField.getText() + keyEvent.getText());
                    } else {
                        commandResult = logic.execute(commandTextField.getText().substring(0,
                                commandTextField.getText().length() - 1));
                    }
                    // process result of the command
                    logger.info("Result: " + commandResult.feedbackToUser);
                    raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(commandResult.feedbackToUser));
                }
            } catch (CommandException | ParseException e) {
               // .. command failure logic ..
            }
        }
    }
----
[NOTE]
The entered key is not instantly updated in the command box thats why after the `commandTextField.getText()` is executed we need to append\delete a character for the
 code to the result to process the right input - the one that the user can see on their screens.

==== Design consideration
===== Aspect: User Interface (UI)

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**Show the search results without actually highlighting the keywords** +
(current choice)
|Allows more readability of the of the results as they contain multiple fields and not just user name.
|User needs to manually search for the keywords entered by him in the search results.

|**Show the search results WITH highlighting the keywords in the searched name** +
|It will make it easier for the user to view the user to identify the searched keyword in the displayed results.
|Adding highlights to the results might make the displayed results a bit too cluttered specially with the presence of tags which are colored as well.

|===
// end::search[]

// tag::view[]
=== Toggling between tab views
==== Current Implementation

This command toggles the view between the different type of tabs in the software. +

.Reference of the tab view in the software
image::TabView.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

It inherits `Command` and executes on an _Event Driven_ design between the Logic and UI component.

Suppose that the user is on the `Task` tab and wants to toggle to the `Exercise` tab. The user executes a new `Command`, `view exercise`, to switch to the `Exercise` tab. The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other.

.Logic and UI component interaction for `view exercise` command (part 1)
image::SDforViewExercise.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

[NOTE]
Note how the `Logic` simply raises a `TabLoadChangedEvent` when the `view` command gets executed. The `TabLoadChangedEvent` is implemented as follows:
[source,java]
----
public class TabLoadChangedEvent extends BaseEvent {
    public final String type;

    public TabLoadChangedEvent(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.getClass().getSimpleName();
    }

    public String getTabName() {
        return type;
    }
}
----

The diagram below shows how the `EventCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the UI updating to which tab view is to be in selection.

.Logic and UI component interaction for `view exercise` command (part 2)
image::SDforViewExerciseEventHandling.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

[NOTE]
The UI scene's elements are automatically populated in `MainWindow.java` due to using JavaFX FXML Controller. That is, a reference to a particular UI element will be available as long as it has its `fx:id` specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

The code snippet below shows how the UI component executes the toggling of tab view upon receiving the event change.
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleTabLoadChangedEvent(TabLoadChangedEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    SingleSelectionModel<Tab> selectionModel = tabPlaceholder.getSelectionModel();
    switch (event.getTabName()) {
    case "profile":
        selectionModel.select(profilePlaceholder);
        break;
    case "task":

=== View, answer, and save for an exercise
==== Current Implementation

This command allows user to answer an exercise based on the question index shown in the software.

.Reference of the question index in the software
image::QuestionIndexIndication.png[width="300"]

{sp} +

It inherits `UndoableCommand` and executes through all four components in the code base.

Suppose that the user wants to answer an exercise with index 11.1.1. The user executes a new `Command`, `ans 11.1.1 a`, to answer the exercise. The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other.

.Component interactions for `ans 11.1.1 a` command (part 1)
image::SDforAnswerExercise.png[width="800"]

{sp}+

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ProgressCheckerChangedEvent` when the ProgressChecker data has been changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

{sp} +

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk.

.Component interactions for `ans 11.1.1 a` command (part 2)
image::SDforAnswerExerciseEventHandling.png[width="800"]

{sp} +

Before the `Logic` component executes the `Undoable Command` which calls the `Model`, it prepares the exercise that needs to be updated by going through the internal list of exercises stored in model. The code that searches for the exercise is as follows:
[source,java]
----
for (Exercise e : exerciseList) {
    if (e.getQuestionIndex().toString().equals(questionIndex.toString())) {
        exerciseToEdit = exerciseList.get(exerciseList.indexOf(e));
        editedExercise = createEditedExercise(exerciseToEdit, studentAnswer);
        isFound = true;
        break;
    }
}
----

The internal list, `exerciseList`, is implemented as an observable list of filtered exercises in `Model`. Upon calling the `ProgressCheckerChangedEvent`, `Storage` will run `saveProgressChecker`. Subsequently, to load the data on the next software start up requires parsing of xml data into `Model`. The following code snippet shows how `Storage` does so:
[source,java]
----
public Exercise toModelType() throws IllegalValueException {
    if (this.questionIndex == null) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(
                String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT,
                QuestionIndex.class.getSimpleName()));
    }
    if (!QuestionIndex.isValidIndex(this.questionIndex)) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(QuestionIndex.MESSAGE_INDEX_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    final QuestionIndex questionIndex = new QuestionIndex(this.questionIndex);

    if (this.questionType == null) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(
                String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT,
                QuestionType.class.getSimpleName()));
    }
    if (!QuestionType.isValidType(this.questionType)) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(QuestionType.MESSAGE_TYPE_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    final QuestionType questionType = new QuestionType(this.questionType);

    ...

    return new Exercise(questionIndex, questionType, question, studentAnswer, modelAnswer);
}
----

Additionally, since it is an observable list, the UI element harboring this list will update any changes made to this list accordingly. In viewing of exercises by week, the list is filtered with predicate as follows:
[source,java]
----
model.updateFilteredExerciseList(exercise -> exercise.getQuestionIndex().getWeekNumber()
                == editedExercise.getQuestionIndex().getWeekNumber());
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Viewing of exercises by week

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**Adapt from `View Command` by adding additional WEEK_NUMBER parameter to type `exercise`** +
(current choice)
|Not required to create a new command and hence more cohesive with the existing commands as well as one less command for users to learn
|`ViewCommandParser` requires additional parser check to separate between the `View Command` that can take in WEEK_NUMBER to one that doesn't which might violate SLAP principle

|**Create a new command to list exercises by week** +
|Standalone from existing commands and hence easier to be built upon or removed without consequences
|Creates an extra unnecessary complication for users having to learn a new command when the existing `View Command` essentially does something similar

|===

===== Aspect:  Loading of exercises data on fresh start

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons

|**Include all exercises data in `SampleDataUtil` and read from there** +
(current choice)
|No additional processing required, is easy to modify whenever default data needs to be changed
|Is directly affected by the `Clear Command` that is meant for the list of `Persons` which user may not expect it to be for

|**Read from stored text file, parse accordingly, and load into software on fresh start** +
|Standalone data and will not be affected by changes made to list of `Persons`
|Incurs extra overhead when parsing the text file into Java objects

|===
// end::answer[]

// tag::tasks[]
=== Tasks
==== Current Implementation

The default LOs for all weeks would be stored in a local file, which will be loaded as input to create a task list on the
user's Google Account with Google Tasks API.

There are several commands related to tasks, including `newtasklist` to add and upload the default task list, `viewtasklist FILTER_KEYWORD`
to view the default task list with filtering, `completetask INDEX`/`resettask INDEX` to mark a task as completed/not completed,
and `goto INDEX` to open the URL of a task. As an example, the _High Level Sequence Diagram_ and _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact
for the scenario where the user issues the command `viewtasklist 5`.

.Component Interactions for `viewtasklist 5` Command (High Level)

{sp} +

{sp} +

We apply Google Tasks API to help us save user tasks data online. This offers back up data which allow our users to recover
their tasks and status of each task even after uninstalling the application. The task list will be ready to display once the user
reinstall and open the application.
To use Google Tasks API, we fist need to register this project on google developer console and retrieve a client credential file (client_id.json) to authorize our project.
Then, add corresponding dependencies to build.gradle, the library files will be downloaded automatically upon project rebuild.

Here is the code snippet to add dependencies:
[source,java]
----
compile (
    ['com.google.api-client:google-api-client:1.23.0'],
    ['com.google.apis:google-api-services-tasks:v1-rev49-1.23.0'],
    ['com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client-jetty:1.23.0'],
)
----
[NOTE]
Simply downloading JAR files without editing gradle is not suggested. JARs are not in git thus our co-developers will rely on the dependencies to retrieve the libraries.
Also, set gradleVersion to 4.6 if it is an older version, otherwise runtime compilation of Google API library will affect Junit tests.

We write a program to authorize our project (by loading the aforementioned client credential file), trigger user loggin and build service.
Note that when users are using ProgressChecker, only the first tasks command requires them to log in and authorize ProgressChecker to access
their Google Tasks data with their google accounts.

Google Tasks API helps us save time building massive data structures (ie. Tasks, TaskLists, Lists of TaskLists, as well as many methods and exceptions).
However, we do have a few classes (eg. TaskUtil, TaskListUtil) in the modeling part that further add customized methods which are useful for current commands and even future commands.
In this way, we avoid repetition of code snippet and having big chunks of import statements in numerous commands.

Here is a code snippet that can find a task list by its title (while the native method only finds task by its id which is not memorable or even known by our users):
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Finds the task list with title {@code String listTitle} from the user's task lists
 *
 * @param listTitle title of the task list we look for
 * @return the task list instance
 */
public static TaskList searchTaskList(String listTitle) throws CommandException {
    TaskList taskList = null;
    ConnectTasksApi connection = new ConnectTasksApi();
    try {
        connection.authorize();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new CommandException(AUTHORIZE_FAILURE);
    }
    Tasks service = connection.getTasksService();
    try {
    TaskLists taskLists = service.tasklists().list().execute();
        taskList = taskLists.getItems().stream()
                .filter(t -> t.getTitle().equals(listTitle))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        throw new CommandException(LOAD_FAILURE);
    }

    return taskList;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of tasks commands

* All these commands extend `Command` but not extend `UndoableCommand`. `AddDefaultTasksCommand`, `CompleteTaskCommand` and `ResetTaskCommand` make
 external changes that update task list in users' Google account, which is out of the scope of undo command. `ViewTaskListCommand` and
 `GoToTaskUrlCommand` do not make changes to the data, thus no applicable to undo command.

===== Aspect: How `AddDefaultTasksCommand` is executed

* This command will load the tasks from local storage and add a task list filled with these tasks to the user's Google account.
|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Find the user's Google task list with ID "@default" (this is the default task list in Google Task and not removable). Create a new
task list and transfer the tasks from @default to the new one. Then change the title of @default to "CS2103 LOs", and add the tasks
loaded from local storage** +
(current choice)
|The other tasks commands will only need to refer to the ID "@default" to find the task list, which is faster and more accurate than searching with title (
as list ID is unique while list title can duplicate and the native API method only supports finding list with ID).
|It requires more steps, thus slower (but fortunately this command should only be executed ONCE in the lifetime of this application).

|**Create a new list with title "CS2103 LOs", then load and push all tasks from local storage**
|Will be a bit faster.
|The other task commands will be slower since they will be finding the list with title. The commands may also encounter error if
there are task list with the same name in the user's Google account.

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: How `ViewTaskListCommand` is executed

* This command will load the tasks from task list @default from the user's Google account and apply user-specified filter before displaying
|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Find the user's @default task list and load the whole list. Then apply user-specified filter to select applicable
tasks to form a new list. The new list will be ready to be displayed** +
(current choice)
|Easy to implement, well modularized.
|More repetitions of list traversal.

|**Find the user's @default task list and load the whole list. Then apply user-specified filter to select applicable
   tasks while processing the methods to display it**
|Easy to implement.
|Might lead to complicated methods to display list (eg. multi-level abstraction).

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: How `CompleteTaskCommand` and `ResetTaskCommand` is executed

* This command will set the task with user-input index number as completed/ not completed.
|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Find the user's @default task list and retrieve the task with user-input index number. Check if it needs update, and update it
if necessary.** +
(current choice)
|Easy to implement.
|

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: How `GoToTaskUrl` is executed

* This command will open the URL of the task with the user-input index number.
|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Find the user's @default task list and retrieved the task based on the input index. Get the URL in the task object and open it in
the browser panel** +
(current choice)
|Easy to implement.
|

|**No need for implementation, the user can click the hyperlink while viewing the task list**
|No need for implementation.
|Not command line based.

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: What UI structure to show the task list

|===
|Alternative | Pros | Cons
|**Use a browser panel.** +
(current choice)
|Can show task list and external websites linked to tasks in the same panel.
|Exercise list, issue list and person list are all shown in a list panel. The handling of browser panel and list panel is different,
which leads to inconsistency.

|**Use a list panel to display tasks, and a browser panel to display external webpages**
|Guarantees consistency between task list, exercise list, issue list and person list.
|Takes more space.

|===

{sp} +

===== Aspect: What can we improve / what command can we add in v2.0

* Send reminder email to the user when a deadline is near
* Back/Forward the browser panel
* View teammates' task list and progress (Google Tasks does not support it. Thus, a possible implementation is to sync data
with the help of Google Drive API. After every transaction with Google Tasks, we retrieve the task list and save in Google Drive.
Students in the same team will use a shared folder on Google Drive, thus can access each other's task list data. ProgressChecker will
retrieve teammate task list data from the shared folder in Google Drive).

{sp} +
// end::tasks[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation. This section talks about how you can modify and publish the existing documentations.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Testing]]
== Testing

ProgressChecker uses JUnit tests to check for its correctness. This section covers the type of tests and how to run them.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.progresschecker.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.progresschecker.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.progresschecker.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.progresschecker.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

It might be your first time working with a large code base. If so, here is a suggested path for new programmers to kick start your first functionality:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove teammates in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParser.java[`ProgressCheckerParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParser.java[`ProgressCheckerParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the ProgressChecker, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the ProgressChecker.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ProgressChecker.java[`ProgressChecker`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ProgressChecker.java[`ProgressChecker`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ProgressChecker.java[`ProgressChecker`] allows you to update a teammate, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ProgressChecker.java[`ProgressChecker`]. Loop through each teammates, and remove the `tag` from each teammate.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `ProgressChecker#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/ProgressChecker.java[`ProgressChecker`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your ProgressChecker application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last teammate in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside teammate cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the ProgressChecker is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of teammates when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleProgressCheckerChangedEvent(ProgressCheckerChangedEvent)`] to update the number of teammates whenever there are new changes to the progresschecker.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/ProgressCheckerSystemTest.java[`ProgressCheckerSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of teammates status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the ProgressChecker to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the ProgressChecker after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the ProgressChecker storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupProgressChecker(ReadOnlyProgressChecker)`, so that the ProgressChecker can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/storage/ProgressCheckerStorage.java[`ProgressCheckerStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/storage/XmlProgressCheckerStorage.java[`XmlProgressCheckerStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `progresschecker`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a teammate specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first teammate to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first teammate.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParser.java[`ProgressCheckerParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParserTest.java[`ProgressCheckerParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParser.java[`ProgressCheckerParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/logic/parser/ProgressCheckerParserTest.java[`ProgressCheckerParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `progressChecker.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonProgressChecker.xml`, `typicalPersonsProgressChecker.xml`, `validProgressChecker.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `us` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/progresschecker/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a teammate.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
