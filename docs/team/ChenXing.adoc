== PROJECT: NUSCouples

---

== Overview

It aims to help these couples create and remember new memories during their time in NUS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability View/Add/Delete Calendar commands*
** What it does: What it does is that it will show the Calendar Window when the App is opened. This Calendar have the ability to change the View of the calendar, adding new event(s) to it and deleting the event(s).
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs a decent looking calendar with some basic features to keep them reminded and manage upcoming events with his/her partner or other miscellaneous events.
** Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and external Calendar API.
** Credits: This features uses CalendarFx API interface, however the interface is in GUI so i manipulated commands to morph into a CLI calendar interface to fit into this project. _

* *Minor enhancement*: added keystrokes to the command box to ease the user by managing the caret to jump from last index to first index and vice versa.

* *Future enhancement*: will be implementing Google Calendar to sync the Calendar in the App currently.
