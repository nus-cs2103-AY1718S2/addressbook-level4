== Overview

My Team Manager (MTM) is a team managing application for football coaches. MTM is designed to be quick and easy for you to manage a team of players without the need of a mouse.

This developer's guide provides information that will not only show the design principles of the project, but allow you to understand the different implementations, and give you the opportunity to get started with being a contributor or as a reference for experienced developer.

This developer's guide consist of the following sections:

* <<Setting up, Setting up>>
* <<Design, Design>>
* <<Implementation, Implementation>>
* <<Documentation, Documentation>>
* <<Testing, Testing>>
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>>
// end::overview[]

== Setting up

The following pointers teach you how to get started with developing on our application. You’ll learn how to prepare yourself with the project on IntelliJ and run it. Then, you’ll update configurations in IntelliJ to easily match the coding standards and you’ll be ready to start coding.

But before you start, there are two fundamental prerequisites you should know about MTM:

=== Prerequisites

MTM is written in Java 8 and with the use of an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ, it provides you as a developer with a better environment suited for developing MTM to maintain coding standards and provide continuous integration.

. You are required to have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later,
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can download Java 8 from link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151[here].
+

. and *IntelliJ* IDE.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them. +
You can download IntelliJ from link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here].


=== Setting up the project on your computer

Before you begin setting up the project, please ensure that you’ve done the following on our GitHub repository (repo).

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

Upon completion of forking from our GitHub repo, you can proceed to set up your project on IntelliJ.

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message which will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Now that you’ve properly setup your project, you can verify that you have done everything properly.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

You have verified the setup and you’re all ready to dive into the code, but before you do, check out the following configurations that will help you make your coding more integrated and accurate.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

=== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Dive right in and get started with programming.

== Design

After you have successfully configured MTM, you are encouraged to read through the following section to understand the design of the software. The design section covers a high level overview the architecture and components of the software, as well as how common classes, configuration and logging throughout development are being used.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Software Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below (Figure 1) explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI Component contains a MainWindow that consists of various parts e.g. CommandBox, ResultDisplayer, TeamDetails, PersonListPanel, PlayerDetails etc. The UI classes are all child classes of the abstract UiPart class.

The structure of the UI component is shown in the figure below:

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PlayerDetails` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The Logic Component handles how each command would be parsed and executed. The class diagrams below illustrates the structure of the Logic Component and the structure of each individual commands.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The Model Component handles the players and teams data structures in My Team Manager.  These structures also provide APIs to create, read, update and delete the details of these objects. The class diagram below shows the structure of the Model Component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

Any changes made to the data is retained and handled by the Storage Component. The structure of this component is shown in Figure 10 below.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

All classes used by the different components can be found in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::logging[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Configuration,Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
// end::logging[]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Pre-existing

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo/Redo feature
===== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Logic Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Undo/Redo Stack Diagram (Part 1)
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (Part 1)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Undo/Redo Stack Diagram (Part 2)
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Undo/Redo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (Part 2)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (Part 3)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Undo/Redo Activity Diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`.
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`.
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


====== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo.
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Player-Related Enhancements

// tag::player[]
==== Player Component `[since v1.3]`

`Player` is one of the core components of MTM. To implement it, we used the same `Person` object and added additional attributes to it. Shown below is the
new constructor for the Person object followed by the class diagram.

[source, java]
----
public Person(Name name, Phone phone, Email email, Address address, Remark remark, TeamName teamName,
                  Set<Tag> tags, Rating rating, Position position, JerseyNumber jerseyNumber, Avatar avatar) {
        ...
        this.remark = remark;
        this.teamName = teamName;
        this.rating = rating;
        this.position = position;
        this.jerseyNumber = jerseyNumber;
        this.avatar = avatar;
    }
----
.Person Class Diagram
image::PlayerClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

The additional attributes are: <<team,teamName>>, <<remark,Remark>>, <<rating,Rating>>, <<position,Position>>, <<jersey,Jersey Number>> and <<avatar,Avatar>>.

The add and edit command has also been updated to include <<team,teamName>>,<<rating,Rating>>, <<position,Position>>, <<jersey,Jersey Number>> and <<avatar,Avatar>>.
One thing to note is that in `executeUndoableCommand()`
in both add and edit commands now does two additional things, setting the file path for players avatar, and assigning a player to a team
and adding person to current filtered list. Shown below is the code snippet of the new `executeUndoableCommand()` and sequence diagram
of the new add command as an example.

[[AddSequence]]
[source, java]
----
 @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            if (!toAdd.getAvatar().toString().equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD)) {
                toAdd.getAvatar().setFilePath(toAdd.getName().fullName);
            }
            model.addPerson(toAdd);
            if (!toAdd.getTeamName().toString().equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD)) {
                model.assignPersonToTeam(toAdd, toAdd.getTeamName());
                model.updateFilteredPersonList(toAdd.getTeamName());
                EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new HighlightSelectedTeamEvent(toAdd.getTeamName().toString()));
            } else { ...
----
.Add Sequence Diagram
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


[[rating]]
===== Rating Class

The `Rating` class contains a `String value`. `value` holds the players rating, an integer from 0 to 5. It uses a validation regex `[0-5]`
to ensure valid input.

The prefix for `Rating` is `ra/`

[[position]]
===== Position Class

The`Position` class contains a `String value`. `value` here holds the players position, an integer from 1 to 4. It uses a validation regex `[1-4]` to ensure valid input.

The prefix for `Position` is `po/`.


A static hashmap is used to store and retrieve the corresponding position names of the position values. The position name can be called using the method `getPositionName()` which returns `myMap.get(value)`.
The code snippet for the `hashmap` and `getPositionName()` is shown below.

[source, java]
----
private static final Map<String, String> myMap;
static {
    Map<String, String> aMap = new HashMap<>();
    aMap.put("1", "Striker");
    aMap.put("2", "Midfielder");
    aMap.put("3", "Defender");
    aMap.put("4", "Goalkeeper");
    myMap = Collections.unmodifiableMap(aMap);
}

public String getPositionName() {
    return myMap.get(value);
}

----

[[jersey]]
===== JerseyNumber Class

The`JerseyNumber` class contains a `String value`. `value` here holds the players jersey number, an integer from 0 to 99. It uses a validation regex `[0-9]|[1-8][0-9]|9[0-9]` to ensure valid input.

The prefix for `Position` is `j/`.

[[avatar]]
===== Avatar Class

The`Avatar` class contains a `String value`. `value` here holds the absolute filepath to the players avatar image file, a png of jpeg file. It uses a validation regex `([^\s]+(\.(?i)(jpg|png))$)` to ensure valid input.

The prefix for `Avatar` is `av/`.

When the class is created, the `value` stores the original location of the players avatar image file eg. `C:\image.png` or if not specified, stores "<UNSPECIFIED>".
Thereafter, if the avatar is specified when <<AddSequence,adding>> or editing a player, `setFilePath()` is called which will attempt to copy the image file to a `/image` folder that is in the same directory as the `MTM.jar` file.
`value` is then updated to the new file path.

The code snippet for setFilePath() is shown below.

[source, java]
----
public void setFilePath(String player) throws IOException {
        if (value.equals("<UNSPECIFIED>")) {
            return;
        }
        final File file = new File(value);

        Path dest = new File("images/" + player.replaceAll("\\s+", "") + ".png").toPath();
        Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("images")); // Creates missing directories if any
        Files.copy(file.toPath(), dest, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        this.value = dest.toString();
    }
----

// end::player[]

// tag::remark[]
==== Remark a Player `[since v1.1]`

Leaving a remark would be ideal for the user to note down any important detail of a player that is useful in the future.
Remarks given can be in any format and therefore would not look good if it was done using tags instead, as tags are used with minimal words.

===== Current Implementation
The remark mechanism is facilitated by `RemarkCommand` and it inherits from `UndoableCommand`, making it undoable. The mechanism allows user to perform the adding, editing, and deleting of a single remark to a specified `Person` via the `INDEX` from the list shown in the `UI`. The field `remark` is similar to the other fields of `Person`, hence some of its logic in `AddCommand.java` and `EditCommand.java` are updated.

The mechanism uses the command `remark` and a `r/` prefix to add, edit, and delete a single remark of a `Person`. When the user leaves the remark as empty after the `r/` prefix, it is an indication to delete the remark, and when it is valid, it either create a new remark for that `Person` or overwrites the current existing remark. Only one `remark` is saved at a time. If the user `remark` on the same person, it will be overwritten.

The field `remark` is found in `Person`, and it is not modified via `add` or `edit` commands. All functions related to `remark` is done strictly via the `remark` command.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `remark` command:

.Remark Activity Diagram
image::RemarkActivityDiagram.png[width="100%"]

The `remark` field is not required when adding or editing a `Person`, and it will be initialized to an empty string or retrieved to fit the implementation of the other fields.

Code snippet from `AddCommandParser.java` that shows how remark is initialized as empty.

[source, java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    //...AddCommandParser code...
    Remark remark = new Remark("");

    Person person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, remark, teamName, tagList, rating,
        position, jerseyNumber, avatar);
    //...AddCommandParser code...
}
----

Code snippet from `EditCommand.java` that shows how remark is being retrieved.

[source, java]
----
private static Person createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit,
    EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {
    //...EditCommand code...
    Remark updatedRemark = (personToEdit.getRemark().isPrivate()) ? personToEdit.getRemark()
                                                                  : personToEdit.getRemark();

    return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedRemark,
        updatedTeamName, updatedTags, updatedRating, updatedPosition, updatedJerseyNumber,
        updatedAvatar);
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `Remark` field

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates an additional `remark` field in `Person`.
** Pros: Follows the existing style of similar fields, making implementation easier.
** Cons: Could only have 1 remark per person, unless `remark` mechanism follows the `tag` mechanism to have multiple remarks.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a list of remarks that associates with the specified `Person`.
** Pros: Can have multiple remarks associating with a specific `Person`.
** Cons: Harder to maintain, more complicated.

====== Aspect: Implementation of `Remark` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a specific command for remarking `Person`.
** Pros: Optional for user to enter remark during add, and have an isolated command to give remarks to a player that works as an add and edit command for remark.
** Cons: Increases the number of commands available for the user, and could mistaken that remark can be done using add/edit command.
* **Alternative 2:** Make it similar to how other fields are implemented in `Person`.
** Pros: Quick and easy implementation as it uses the same format as other fields, and can be added and modified through `add` and `edit` commands.
** Cons: An additional field that can be input when adding a player, making the process longer to execute the command.

// tag::privatefield[]
==== Setting various player fields to private `[since v1.4]`
===== Current Implementation

`Phone`, `Email`, `Remark`, `Rating` and `Address` of a player has an additional boolean attribute
`isPrivate` which tracks the privacy of the particular field. When a player is added into MTM, `isPrivate` of these
fields are set to 'false' by default.

Each of these fields have a different `toString` method which would return `<Private 'FIELD'>` if privacy of
the field is set to 'true', as shown in the following code snippet:
[source, java]
----
@Override
    public String toString() {
        if (isPrivate) {
            return "<Private Address>";
        }
        return value;
    }
----

`XmlAdaptedPerson` under the storage portion has been edited to save the `isPrivate` value for the fields:
[source, java]
----
@XmlElement(required = true)
    private Boolean phonePrivacy;
----

Toggling of privacy works in a similar way to `Edit`. New fields will be created with privacy settings of `EditPersonPrivacy`
 based on user input. This is done by first detecting if a particular prefix is present when command is
entered in `TogglePrivacyCommandParser`:
[source, java]
----
if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE).isPresent()) {
            epp.setPrivatePhone(false);
        }
----
If prefix of a field is not present, the privacy setting of that particular field in `EditPersonPrivacy` would be null.

In `TogglePrivacyCommand`, the new fields are created with this:
[source, java]
----
private static Phone createPhonePrivacy(Person person, EditPersonPrivacy epp) {
        Phone phone;
        try {
            if (person.getPhone().isPrivate()) {
                person.getPhone().togglePrivacy();
                phone = new Phone(person.getPhone().toString());
                person.getPhone().togglePrivacy();
            } else {
                phone = new Phone(person.getPhone().toString());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new AssertionError("Invalid Phone");
        }
        if (epp.getPrivatePhone() != null) {
            phone.setPrivate(person.getPhone().isPrivate());
            phone.togglePrivacy();
        } else {
            phone.setPrivate(person.getPhone().isPrivate());
        }

        return phone;
    }
----
Note that in the second portion of the code, if `epp.getPrivatePhone()` is null, this would mean that it's privacy
setting was not toggled and thus is set to the same as it was before. Else, it would be toggled:
[source, java]
----
public void togglePrivacy() {
        this.isPrivate = isPrivate ? false : true;
    }
----

A new person object is then created:
[source, java]
----
private static Person createEditedPrivacyPerson(Person personToEdit, EditPersonPrivacy epp)
            throws IllegalValueException {
        assert personToEdit != null;

        Name updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
        Phone updatedPhone = createPhonePrivacy(personToEdit, epp);
        Email updatedEmail = createEmailPrivacy(personToEdit, epp);
        Address updatedAddress = createAddressPrivacy(personToEdit, epp);
        Remark updatedRemark = createRemarkPrivacy(personToEdit, epp);
        TeamName updatedTeamName = personToEdit.getTeamName();
        Set<Tag> updatedTags = personToEdit.getTags();
        Rating updatedRating = createRatingPrivacy(personToEdit, epp);
        Position updatedPosition = personToEdit.getPosition();
        JerseyNumber updatedJerseyNumber = personToEdit.getJerseyNumber();
        Avatar updatedAvatar = personToEdit.getAvatar();

        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedRemark,
                updatedTeamName, updatedTags, updatedRating, updatedPosition, updatedJerseyNumber, updatedAvatar);
    }
----
and is used to update current person:
[source, java]
----
model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);
----

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: How field privacy is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Boolean `isPrivate` added to field classes.
** Pros: Privacy settings can be obtained straight from class by calling getter method.
** Cons: Adddtional methods are needed to set and get value of `isPrivate`.
* **Alternative 2:** Field privacy settings stored in `Person` in a HashMap.
** Pros: Field privacy can be accessed and modified easily
** Cons: `Person` has to be accessed every time field privacy needs to be checked

====== Aspect: Privacy of fields upon adding of player

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All newly added players' fields are not private by default.
** Pros: `Add` command does not need to be tweaked to allow adding player with private fields.
** Cons: After adding players, user has to do additional command to toggle privacy of fields.
* **Alternative 2:** Include implementation of prefixes that denotes private field during `Add`.
** Pros: Newly added players can have private fields right away.
** Cons: Addtional changes has to be made to `Add` command.
// end::privatefield[]

// tag::sort[]
==== Sorting players by fields `[since v1.2]`
===== Current Implementation

The `sort` command is currently able to sort players by name, email, address, rating, jersey and postition in either ascending or descending order. Support for more fields will be added in subsequent updates.

* The `sort` command is parsed through `SortCommandParser` which hands control to the `SortCommand` class.

* Java Collections Sort API is used together with a custom `Comparator` in this implementation

Sorting is facilitated by the `SortCommand` which uses method `sortPlayers` to ultimately call method `sortBy` in UniquePersonList for the actual sorting as shown in this code snippet:
[source, java]
----
        switch (field) {
                case "name":
                    comparator = nameComparator;
                    break;

                //... code for other switch cases...

                default:
                    throw new AssertionError("Invalid field parameter entered...\n");
                }

        switch (order) {
        case "asc":
            Collections.sort(internalList, comparator);
            break;

        case "desc":
            Collections.sort(internalList, Collections.reverseOrder(comparator));
            break;

        default:
            throw new AssertionError("Invalid field parameter entered...\n");
        }
    }
----

The code above utilises a custom `Comparator` defined in the sample code below:
[source, java]
----
        Comparator<Person> nameComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
                    @Override
                    public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                        return p1.getName().fullName.compareTo(p2.getName().fullName);
                    }
                };
----

The following sequence diagram shows the program flow when `sort` is used:

.Sort Sequence Diagram
image::sortSeq.png[width="900"]

[NOTE]
If address book is empty, a `NoPlayerException` will be thrown by `sortBy` method in UniquePlayerList.

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: Implementation of `sort`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorting is done in `UniquePersonList`.
** Pros: Sorting methods resides in class that handles most operations done to list. Future changes to implementation would be easier.
** Cons: Complicated flow of control passed between classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Sorting is done in `SortCommand`.
** Pros: Easier to trace flow of control as lesser passing between classes.
** Cons: Unnecessary coupling if `UniquePersonList` has to rely on `SortCommand`.

====== Aspect: Sort by multiple fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort can only be done by 1 field.
** Pros: Easy to implement and input is straightforward.
** Cons: Unable to fine tune to great detail how teams are sorted and displayed.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort can be done by multiple fields.
** Pros:  Able to fine tune to great detail how teams are sorted and displayed.
** Cons: Unnecessary as team managers would not need to sort players by multiple fields.

====== Aspect: Sort Persistence

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Address book is saved after sorting.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Allows team managers to use preferred sort pattern in every session.
** Cons: Previous order of players will be lost.
* **Alternative 2:** Address book is not saved after sorting.
** Pros: Good if team manager wants to sort players for current session only.
** Cons: Sort order is lost when program exits. More memory is used to sort a list and reverse it after.
// end::sort[]

=== Team-Related Enhancements

// tag::team[]
[[team]]
==== Team Component `[since v1.2]`

One of the core components to MTM is `Team`, and it is the base to creating more commands for the user to access capability on team management. The `Team` component provides user with better organizational methods for organizing their players and interact with multiple teams to manage them effectively.

===== Current Implementation

We achieved the implementation of `Team` component by introducing a `UniqueTeamList` into the application which consists of a list of `Team` objects. `UniqueTeamList` is similar in context to `UniquePersonList` in which it keeps a unique list of all the `Team` objects. `Team` objects consist of `TeamName` object, which is used to uniquely identify the team. `Team` inherits `UniquePersonList` object which stores the a list of unique `Person` objects, containing information of the player.

The class diagrams below shoes the relationship between the related classes. The Team Class Diagrams are an extension to the current existing Designs of <<Design-Model, `Model`>>, <<Design-Storage, `Storage`>>, and <<Design-Ui, `UI`>>.

.Model Component: Team Class Diagram
image::TeamModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Storage Component: Team Class Diagram
image::TeamStorageClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

.UI Component: Team Class Diagram
image::TeamUiClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

Code snippet from `Team.java` that shows the constructor for `Team`.

[source, java]
----
public class Team {
    private final TeamName teamName;

    public Team(TeamName teamName) {
        this.teamName = teamName;
    }
}
----

For the application to store the information of `Team` into a list, we will need to introduce a new `UniqueTeamList` variable into the `AddressBook.java`, so that it will have a container for all the new `Team` objects that is going to be created in MTM.

Code snippet from `AddressBook.java` that shows the declaration and initialization of `UniqueTeamList`.

[source, java]
----
public class AddressBook implements ReadOnlyAddressBook {
    //...AddressBook code...
    private final UniqueTeamList teams;

    {
        teams = new UniqueTeamList;
    }

    public void setTeams(List<Team> teams) throws DuplicateTeamException {
        this.teams.setTeams(teams);
    }

    @Override
    public ObservableList<Team> getTeamList() {
        return teams.asObservableList();
    }
    //...AddressBook code...
}
----

Since `Team` inherits the `UniquePersonList` class, we are able to store `Person` object into `Team` by using the super class method `add` in `UniquePersonList`. By storing a list of players inside `Team` object, future enhancements can easily make use of the data to perform functions that requires quick access to all players in a team. However, this have created a coupling in which data made to the `changes made to `AddressBook.persons` needs to be updated in `Team` to maintain synchronicity.

Code snippet from `AddressBook.java` that shows the propagation of details updated in `Person` from the full player list to the `Person` objects in `Team`.

[source, java]
----
public void updatePerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)
    throws DuplicatePersonException, PersonNotFoundException {
    requireNonNull(editedPerson);
    //...syncEditedPerson initialisation...

    if (!editedPerson.getTeamName().toString().equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD)) {
        teams.getTeam(editedPerson.getTeamName()).setPerson(target, editedPerson);
    }
    persons.setPerson(target, syncedEditedPerson);
}
----

An additional `TeamName` field is also added to `Person` so that the user can quickly determine the team the player is in through the use of `PREDICATE`.

Code snippet from `Person.java` that shows the `TeamName` field.

[source, java]
----
public class Person {

    private final TeamName teamName;

    public Person(Name name, Phone phone, Email email, Address address, Remark remark,
        TeamName teamName, Set<Tag> tags, Rating rating, Position position,
        JerseyNumber jerseyNumber, Avatar avatar) {
        //...attributes initialisation...
        this.teamName = teamName;
    }

    public TeamName getTeamName() {
        return teamName;
    }
}
----

Code snippet from `ModelManager.java` that shows the use of filtering the person list using the `TeamName` field in `Person`.

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void updateFilteredPersonList(TeamName targetTeam) throws TeamNotFoundException {
    requireNonNull(targetTeam);

    List<Team> teamList = addressBook.getTeamList();

    if (teamList.stream().anyMatch(target -> target.getTeamName().equals(targetTeam))) {
        filteredPersons.setPredicate(t -> t.getTeamName().equals(targetTeam));
    } else {
        throw new TeamNotFoundException();
    }
}
----

Additional exception classes are also created so that these new exceptions can be thrown during the program, such that when these exceptions are thrown, the code is easily comprehensible.

.`TeamNotFoundException.java`
[source, java]
----
public class TeamNotFoundException extends Exception {
    //...TeamNotFoundException...
}
----

.`DupliecateTeamException.java`
[source, java]
----
public class DuplicateTeamException extends DuplicateDataException {
    //...DuplicateTeamException...
}
----

Implementing a new component into MTM, the data consisting of `Team` is also stored into storage using `XmlAdaptedTeam.java` to format the output.

Code snippet from `XmlAdaptedTeam.java` that shows the elements that will be stored into storage.

[source, java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedTeam {
    @XmlElement(required = true)
    private String teamName;
    @XmlElement
    private List<XmlAdaptedPerson> players = new ArrayList<>();
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `Team`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Team` object stores a `Person` object that is also in `UniquePersonList` and `TeamName` is also an attribute of `Person`.
** Pros: Provides an easier lookup of person belonging in which team without the need of iterating through the `UniqueTeamList` for a specific `Person`, and provide ease of access to data for future enhancements.
** Cons: Checks to ensure synchronicity need to be done thoroughly to ensure that player information is in sync between Team and full player list
* **Alternative 2:** `Team` object is stored in `Person` object as an attribute.
** Pros: Logical thought process to include `Team` as an attribute.
** Cons: Excess storage wasted due to duplicated data of `Team` in every `Person`.
// end::team[]

// tag::teamfunction[]
==== Team Functions `[since v1.4]`

To assist the user with manging teams, we have decided to use the design concept of Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) to implement commands related to `Team`.
This set of commands provide the basic necessities for the user to efficiently use our application.

===== Current Implementation

Based on the principles of CRUD, we have created the commands that corresponds to each principles, namely, `create`, `view`, `rename` and `assign`, `remove`.
With these commands, the application is ready to support the features that the application is designed to be used.

Team-related commands that modifies the data in the application, such as `create`, `rename`, `assign`, and `remove`, inherits from `UndoableCommand` class which makes all these commands undoable. Each command has its own `Parser` to uniquely parse user input arguments for the commands, so that it is validated and the command understand what it should be doing.

For each feature, new functions are created in `AddressBook.java` and `ModelManager.java` so that the commands executed are able to manipulate the data accordingly.

====== `create`: Creates a `Team`, so that other team-related commands can be executed.
After the creation of a new team, the user will then be able to perform a new set of commands that performs team management functionality. Moreover, the `add` command can be used with the prefix `tm/` to immediately add the user into MTM and into the team specified.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `create` command:

.Logic Component: Create Sequence Diagram
image::TeamCreateSequenceDiagram1.png[width="100%"]

.Model Component: Create Sequence Diagram
image::TeamCreateSequenceDiagram2.png[width="70%"]

====== `view`: Views a `Team`, which shows all players in the team.
The command uses the `filteredPersons` list, and an overloaded `updateFilteredPersonList` method that sets a predicate that filters the list based on a `TeamName`, in `ModelManager.java` so that it can be displayed via the UI.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `view` command:

.View Sequence Diagram
image::TeamViewSequenceDiagram.png[width="100%"]

====== `rename`: Renames a given `Team`.
The user can rename a specified team to a new team name only if the current team name does not existing in MTM. On a side note, it prevents the user from renaming the team to the same name that it currently have.

This command will update the name of the teams that are in `teams` in `AddressBook.java` and will update all the players `TeamName` field in `persons` and `Team` with the new team name.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `rename` command:

.Logic Component: Rename Sequence Diagram
image::TeamRenameSequenceDiagram1.png[width="100%"]

.Model Component: Rename Sequence Diagram
image::TeamRenameSequenceDiagram2.png[width="70%"]

====== `assign`: Assign a set of `Person` to a specified `Team`.
The core feature that organizes the player into teams so that the user can easily view the desired team players quickly. The command have 2 functions, firstly it is able to assign an individual or a set of players to a specified team, and secondly, it is able to unassign an individual or a set of players from any team.

The command takes in a set of indexes that corresponds to the player in the current list, and will perform the assign operation in ascending index order. If the command is unable to process an index given, it will process all the valid index until the index that causes an issue.

[NOTE]
====
Typical issues that the command handles are,

* Assigning a player to the same team that it is currently in.
* Assigning a player to team that does not exist.
* Unassigning a player that does not exist in any team.
* Process index starting from 1.
* Removes all index that exceeds the current number of player listed.
====

This command will update and synchronise all affected players in `persons` and in the specified `Team` object, such that their `TeamName` field in `Person` are updated with the new assigned or unassigned team. At the same time, the list of players in `Team` gets update if new player are assigned or unassigned.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `assign` command:

.Assign Sequence Diagram
image::TeamAssignSequenceDiagram.png[width="100%"]

====== `remove`: Removes the given `Team`.
The final step in completing the CRUD design is the removal of team. It will delete the `Team` from `teams` list in `AddressBook.java` and will update all affected players in the team to be unassigned from the team by having their `TeamName` field updated with an unspecifed field.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of the `remove` command:

.Logic Component: Remove Sequence Diagram
image::TeamRemoveSequenceDiagram1.png[width="100%"]

.Model Component: Remove Sequence Diagram
image::TeamRemoveSequenceDiagram2.png[width="70%"]

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: Implementation of Team Functions
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses CRUD design concept to create new commands.
** Pros: Systematic approach in dealing with what functions should be created to ensure that the product has the features required to perform team management, and provides a platform to work on ideal features that target the needs of the audience.
** Cons: Simple and only captures the basic requirements of the product.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement commands based on suggested features.
** Pros: End product will have features that targets the need of the audiences.
** Cons: Possible to miss out basic and core features of a team management application.

====== Aspect: Undoable commands for Team Functions
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make all functions that modifies data to be undoable.
** Pros: Follows the current implementation of `undo` such that if data are modified in MTM, it will be an undoable command.
** Cons: Need to ensure that regression bugs are squashed when the new commands are executed, and time consuming in identifying regression.
* **Alternative 2:** Make all functions not undoable.
** Pros: Easy to implement and will produce lesser regression bugs.
** Cons: Does not align with the current implementation of `undo` & `redo`, and the user would require more steps to revert any changes made.

==== Show Best XI `[coming in v2.0]`
===== Current Implementation

The `showBest` command is able to show the current team's best 11 players. There is however no functional implementation for this feature yet. Coming soon!
// end::showbestxi[]

=== Usability Enhancements

// tag::key[]
==== Toggle lock on MTM `[since v1.5]`
===== Current Implementation
Locking mechanism of MTM can be toggled on and off using the `Key` command. It utilises the Model to access
user preferences of MTM. Current lock state and password is stored in `UserPrefs` in the Storage component.

This activity diagram shows the logic behind the `Key` command:

.Key Activity Diagram
image::Keyactdiag.png[width="900"]

Password checking done in `Key` command:
[source, java]
----
private boolean correctPassword() {
        UserPrefs up = model.getUserPrefs();
        String hash = Hashing.sha256().hashString(password, StandardCharsets.UTF_8).toString();
        return hash.equals(up.getAddressBookHashedPass());
    }
----
When password check is done, the lock on MTM is toggled to the state opposite of the current:
[source, java]
----
if (correctPassword()) {
            if (model.getLockState()) {
                model.unlockAddressBookModel();
            } else {
                model.lockAddressBookModel();
            }

            logger.info("Lock state is now: " + Boolean.toString(model.getLockState()));
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
        }
----

In a locked state, only certain functions of MTM can be used. This is to prevent unauthorised tampering with the details
stored on MTM.

This is done in `AddressBookParser`. Commands are split into low level or not. When a command is
being executed, it is checked if it falls under the low level category. If so, it would execute. When adding new features,
add them to this list should you feel it is 'low level':
[source, java]
----
private Command lowLevelCommand(String commandWord, String arguments) throws ParseException {
        switch(commandWord) {
        case ChangeThemeCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case ChangeThemeCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new ChangeThemeCommandParser().parse(arguments);

        case FindCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case FindCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new FindCommandParser().parse(arguments);

        case ListCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case ListCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new ListCommand();

        case KeyCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case KeyCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new KeyCommandParser().parse(arguments);

        case ViewCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case ViewCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new ViewCommandParser().parse(arguments);

        case ExitCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
            return new ExitCommand();

        case HelpCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
            return new HelpCommand();

        case SortCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case SortCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new SortCommandParser().parse(arguments);

        default:
            return null;
        }
    }
----
If command being executed does not fall into the category of 'low level', a check on the lock state of MTM is done
before allowing or restricting access:
[source, java]
----
if (lockState) {
            throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_RESTRICTED);
        }
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of locking MTM
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lock is toggled with only a single command `Key`.
** Pros: Easy to implement, just check current lock state and switch it.
** Cons: With a toggle, user might unlock MTM thinking he/she is locking it.
* **Alternative 2:** Locking and unlocking of MTM is done with two separate commands.
** Pros: Ensures that when a lock is done, MTM is truly locked.
** Cons: Addtional command needs to be created, along with its command parser and implementations.

// tag::changepass[]
==== Change Password `[coming in v2.0]`

===== Current Implementation
Default password used for toggling lock on MTM is currently 'ilikesports'. In an upcoming update, user would be able
to change this password to one of his choosing. There is currently no functional implementation for this feature yet.
Coming soon!
// end::changepass[]

=== User Experience Enhancements

// tag::autocomplete[]
==== Tab Autocomplete
===== Current Implementation

The tab autocomplete feature works by handling the Tab key pressed event, searching for any commands with matching prefix and returns one if found.
The command strings are stored in a Trie data structure, named `CommandTrie`, for optimal search.

[source, java]
----
public class CommandTrie {
    String attemptAutoComplete (String input);
    void insert (String input);
    Set<String> getCommandSet();
}
----

The trie is made up of `TrieNode` objects which contains three objects. The `TrieNode sibling` represents a character on the same level as the current one. The `TrieNode child` represents a next possible letter.
For example in the words `edit` and `exit`, the node for `d` would have a child `i` and a sibling `x`. `x` would have a child `i`.

[source, java]
----
public class TrieNode {

    private TrieNode sibling;
    private TrieNode child;
    private char key;
    ...
}

----
Upon the pressing of the tab key, the command box calls `attemptAutoComplete`, in the `commandTrie` class. With the content of the command box as the query, attemptAutoComplete searches for the query using the standard Trie search algortihm.
If the query prefix itself is not present in the trie, then the attempt fails. If the query reaches a `TrieNode` with a `sibling` or `child` `TrieNode`,
it will provide the user with possible commands for a given input. In this case, a dropdown box will appear in the UI that lists the possible commands for the user.

Upon finding a matching command, `attemptAutoComplete` returns it and replaces the text in the Command Line. If the no matching command is found, the text is turned red.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::enhancedadd[]
==== Optional Field Add Command `[since v1.1]`

MTM is designed to manage a multitude of players and the main function that would be used repetitively is the `add` command, hence it would alleviate the cumbersomeness of entering every detail of the players when you want the command to be executed quickly.
Having the option to only entering the mandatory fields and leaving the optional ones empty will make the process of adding players more efficient.

===== Current Implementation
This mechanism enhances the original implementation of the `add` command.
The required fields that are mandatory to be filled by the user are `n/NAME` and `e/EMAIL`.
This implementation of making fields optional for `AddCommand` allows user to add players without their full information, and can be updated accordingly when the user retrieves their full information.

Code snippet from `ParserUtil.java` that shows the implementation of when a field is left empty.
"<UNSPECIFIED>" string will be return when the value passed in is empty.

[source, java]
----
public class ParserUtil {
    public static final String UNSPECIFIED_FIELD = "<UNSPECIFIED>";
    //...ParserUtil code...

    public static Optional<String> parseValue(Optional<String> value, String messageConstraints)
        throws IllegalValueException {
    if (value.isPresent() && value.get().equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD)) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(messageConstraints);
    } else {
        return Optional.of(value.orElse(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD));
    }
    //...ParserUtil code ...
}
----

Code snippet from `AddCommandParser.java` that shows the usage of parsing fields that are set as optional.

[source,java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        //...tokenize arguments...
        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_EMAIL)
            || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        //...get person details from arguments...
        Address address = ParserUtil.parseAddress(ParserUtil.parseValue(argMultimap
            .getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS), Address.MESSAGE_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINTS)).get();

        return new AddCommand(person);
        //...AddCommandParser code...
}
----

Code snippet from `Address.java` that shows an example of an optional field being valid when not specified.

[source, java]
----
public class Address {
    //...Address code...
    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX) || test.equals(UNSPECIFIED_FIELD);
    }
}
----

===== Design Consideration
====== Aspect: Implementation of Optional fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set a default value for unspecified fields and parse fields that are mandatory.
** Pros: Easy to implement as fields are still filled with information even though user did not specify.
** Cons: Unattractive display of fields when it is unspecified.
* **Alternative 2:** Require users to input all fields.
** Pros: The current implementation is used, hence there is no additional code to ensure validity of unspecified input.
** Cons: Less flexibility is given to the user when adding a player into the application.
// end::enhancedadd[]

=== UI Enhancements

// tag::teamDisplay[]
==== Team Display Bar `[since v1.3]`
===== Current Implementation

The Team Display Bar is implemented as `TeamDisplay` in the UI Component and renders `TeamDisplay.fxml`.
It is called from `MainWindow` and highlights
the current team that has been selected in the Command Line Interface by the user. +

It calls the `Team` model and displays the `Player` cards associated with that `Team`.
It contains event handler methods such as handleShowNewTeamEvent(), handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent(),
and handleDeselectTeamEvent(), which update the UI accordingly. +

The component interactions can be seen in the high level sequence diagram for `TeamDisplay` below, using the example of a `create` command:

.Component interactions for `create Team` command
image::ShowNewTeamDiagram.png[width="800"]


Code snippet from 'TeamDisplay' to show initialisation of UI component and event handlers:

[source, java]
----
public class TeamDisplay extends UiPart<Region> {

    private static final String FXML = "TeamDisplay.fxml";

    public TeamDisplay() {
        super(FXML);
        //...initialise Teams code...
        registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleShowNewTeamEvent(ShowNewTeamNameEvent event) {
        //...handleShowNewTeamEvent code...
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent(HighlightSelectedTeamEvent event) {
        //...handleHighlightSelectedTeamEvent code...
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleDeselectTeamEvent(DeselectTeamEvent event) {
        //...handleDeselectTeamEvent code...
    }
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TeamDisplay` is placed underneath the `ResultDisplay` and above the `PersonListPanel`.
** Pros: Located at an obvious location for the user to view the team currently selected.
** Cons: There will be less space for the `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox`.
* **Alternative 2:** `TeamDisplay` is placed on the left of the `PersonListPanel` as a vertical bar.
** Pros: There will be more space for the `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox`.
** Cons: It is less obvious to the user as it is at the side.
// end::teamDisplay[]

// tag::PlayerDetails[]
==== Player Details Pane `[since v1.4]`
===== Current Implementation

The `Player Details` pane is implemented as `PlayerDetails` in the UI Component.
It is called from `PlayerListPanel`. It renders `PlayerDetails.fxml` and displays the selected `PersonCard`.
It calls the `Person` model and displays the fields in the `Person` model that are not displayed in the left panel.
It contains the event handler method handlePersonDetailsChangedEvent(), which updates the UI component when the `edit `
or `remark` commands are entered. +

The component interactions can be seen in the high level sequence diagram for `PlayerDetails` below, using the example of a `remark` command:

.Component interactions for `remark 1 r/test` command
image::PlayerDetailsDiagram.png[width="800"]

Code snippet from 'PlayerDetails' to show initialisation of UI component:

[source, java]
----
public class PlayerDetails extends UiPart<Region> {

    private static final String FXML = "PlayerDetails.fxml";
    public final Person person;

    public PlayerDetails(Person person) {
        super(FXML);
        this.person = person;
        //....player details code...
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handlePersonDetailsChangedEvent(PersonDetailsChangedEvent event) {
        ...handlePersonDetailsChangedEvent code...
    }

}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `PlayerDetails` is placed on the right of `Person List Panel`, replacing the `BrowserPanel`.
** Pros: It is the only large unused space in the software left and is right beside the `Person List Panel`, thus is the logical
place to look at after selection of a person card.
** Cons: This is a lot of whitespace in the pane as are not many fields.
* **Alternative 2:** `PlayerDetails` pane size is reduced and the extra space is repurposed.
** Pros: There will be more space for another new feature e.g. calendar.
** Cons: It can only be implemented in v2.0 due to time constraints in development.

// end::PlayerDetails[]

// tag::changeThemeCommand[]
==== Change Theme Command `[since v1.5]`
===== Current Implementation

The `ChangeThemeCommand` is a new feature that allows user to change the current theme to another theme. A new css class is implemented to accommodate the new theme, LightTheme.
The `MainWindow` class is also changed to contain a handleChangeThemeRequestEvent() method which is an event handler to `setAddressBookTheme`,
which is a method in `UserPrefs`. +

Below is the sequence diagram for how the `ChangeThemeCommand` works:

.Interactions of the Logic Component with the UI and Model Components for the `changeTheme` Command
image::ChangeThemeDiagram.png[width="800"]


Code snippet from 'ChangeThemeCommand':

[source, java]
----
public class ChangeThemeCommand extends Command {

    public ChangeThemeCommand(String theme) {
            this.theme = theme.trim();
    }

   @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        //...check for valid theme code...
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeEvent(this.theme));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_SUCCESS, this.theme));
    }
}
----

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Command Syntax

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The command syntax is in the form "changeTheme Dark" or "changeTheme Light".
** Pros: This supports future implementation of more themes, so that the developer can easily add the new themes without
having to change the execution.
** Cons: The command is longer than it could be. (see alternative 2)
* **Alternative 2:** The command syntax in the form "changeTheme", which would automatically toggle the theme.
** Pros: User does not have to type anything to change the theme, so it might be more user friendly.
** Cons: Future implementation of more themes would be harder for the developer as the toggle function would have to be
changed quite drastically to become a command for selecting a theme out of multiple themes.

====== Aspect: User Experience

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ChangeThemeCommand` is implemented as a CLI command.
** Pros: Consistent with the rest of the application, of which all changes are made by the CLI.
** Cons: User has yet another command to remember the syntax of.
* **Alternative 2:** Change of theme is implemented as a button to change onClick.
** Pros: User does not have to type anything to change the theme, so it might be more user friendly.
** Cons: Inconsistent with the rest of the application, which is CLI-based.
// end::changeThemeCommand[]


// tag::settagcolour[]
==== Set Tag Colour feature `[since v1.1]`
===== Current Implementation

The `Set` Command is an entirely new command that allows the user to assign a colour to a specific tag.
This mechanism is facilitated by the `SetCommandParser`, which creates and returns a new `SetCommand`.
In `SetCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface, it parses the arguments inputted into the CLI, and checks whether the arguments are valid.

`SetCommandParser` is implemented as such:

[source, java]
----
public class SetCommandParser implements Parser<SetCommand> {

    public SetCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    // ...parse arguments and check for invalid arguments...
  }
}
----

`SetCommand` inherits the abstract `Command` class. After `execute()` is called in `SetCommand`, the tag colour is set through the logic portions of `ModelManager` and `AddressBook`, then
lastly changes `tagColour` attribute within the `Tag` object itself. It also posts an event in `SetCommand`, to which
its handler in `PersonCard` responds and performs the UI update. +


`SetCommand` is implemented in this way:

[source, java]
----
public class SetCommand extends Command {

    private final Tag tagToSet;
    private final String tagColour;

    public SetCommand(Tag tag, String colour) {
        requireNonNull(tag);
        tagToSet = tag;
        tagColour = colour;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
    requireNonNull(model);
        boolean isTagValid = model.setTagColour(tagToSet, tagColour);
        //...check for valid tagName code....
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeTagColourEvent(tagToSet.getTagName(), tagColour));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, tagToSet.toString(), tagColour));
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the set command operation works:

.Interactions of the Logic Component with the UI and Model Components for the `setTagColour` Command
image::SetTagCommandDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Implementation of `Command` vs  `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Inherit from `Command`.
** Pros: Does not involve complicated undo/redo tests, simple and quicker implementation,
lessen chances of mistakes made in implementation.
** Cons: User cannot use the `undo/redo` command.
* **Alternative 2 :** Inherit from `UndoableCommand`.
** Pros: User can utilise the `undo/redo` command.
** Cons: Hard for developers to implement extra tests, not very necessary as users can just as easily type
out the colour they would like to change their tag to; it is a short command, especially with the `stc` alias.
// end::settagcolour[]

== Documentation

We use https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoc] for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
If you are intending to develop our software further, it is highly recommended that you run tests in the ways listed below.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops
This section covers resources for you to develop this software with good practices and prepare it for release.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
