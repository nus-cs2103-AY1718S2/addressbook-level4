== Overview

EduBuddy is a desktop application designed for secondary school teachers to manage student information better.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and HTML. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to visualise the student information in a simple and effective way
