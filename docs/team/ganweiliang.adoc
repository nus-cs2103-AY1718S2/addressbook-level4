== Overview
This Project Portfolio details my contributions to project EPIC, showing that I am capable of producing functional code,
and working in a team on a large project.

== PROJECT: EPIC

Event Planning isnâ€™t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*. EPIC handles event attendance management with
simplicity and efficiency. By storing all of the contacts in a common database, the same person
can be registered for multiple events without having to re-enter his or her details for each event.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the `toggle` command to toggle attendance of registrants to events.
** What it does: The `toggle` command allows the user to toggle the attendance of a
registrant based on their index in the Attendance Pane. It toggles the attendance of a
registrant from attended to not attended and vice versa. It also supports undoing and
redoing in both directions.
** Justification: The `toggle` command is an essential functionality of EPIC as
it helps event planners easily manage the attendance of a large number of registrants
within a single GUI.
** Highlights: In order to support attendance related operations, I restructured EPIC
and added the `Attendance` and `UniqueAttendanceList` classes.
* *Minor enhancement*: Updated the structure of the app and added an EpicEvent class in order
to support all operations related to events. Implemented the `add-event` command to support adding of
events to EPIC.
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/william6364.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/william6364.md[Test code]]
