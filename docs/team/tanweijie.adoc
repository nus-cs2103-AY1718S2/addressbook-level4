== PROJECT: Media Socializer

---

== Overview

Media Socializer is a one-stop social media desktop application used to help social media users keep track of all the social media platforms their contacts are using. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to manage the social media platforms of each person*
** What it does: Allows the user to add the associated social media platforms to the specified person by typing in the links to the relevant profile pages or remove them by entering the names of the platforms.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have the application keep track of all the social media profiles of their contacts.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the overall feel of the product, since it is a core feature of the application. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required touching upon multiple components to properly realise such a feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a sort command that allows the user to alphabetically sort the people in the list.
