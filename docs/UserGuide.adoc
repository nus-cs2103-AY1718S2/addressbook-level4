== Introduction

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is an application for the management of health records digitally.
Of note is the fact that IMDB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This makes it perfect for doctors or staff who can type faster than they can navigate with a mouse.
If your clinic has medical staff who can type fast, IMDB can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional pen and paper or even normal GUI apps.
Head to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `imdb.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for IMDB.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds as shown in the figure below.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try out the commands below to get a feel of the app:

* *`login bob password456`*: logs you into the IMDB as Bob. Note that some commands will not work unless you are logged in.
* *`list`* : lists all patients
* **`add`**`n/John Doe ic/S1234567A p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dob/11/11/1991 b/B+` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the IMDB.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
