== PROJECT: TuitionCor

---

== Overview

TuitionCor is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing client information*. More importantly, TuitionCor is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuitionCor can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Match command*
** What it does: Matches a Student to any Tutor in TuitionCor that meets the requirements of the Student (or vice versa).
** Justification: This acts as the main purpose of TuitionCor, which is to help coordinate Students and Tutors that matches in `location`, `subject` and `grade` attributes.
** Highlights: This implementation required the understanding and modification of logic, model, and ui component. It also required in-depth understanding of logic component as it is an integration of multiple command in order to search and sort the clients.

* *Minor enhancement*: enhanced find command that search all the keywords stored in TuiTionCor.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/Zhu-Jiahui.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/Zhu-Jiahui.md[Test code]]
