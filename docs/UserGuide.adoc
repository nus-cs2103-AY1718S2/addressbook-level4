== Introduction

JobbiBot is a desktop Chatbot application for those who *prefer to use an interactive app to source for internship
opportunities*. Hence, JobbiBot is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JobbiBot can find the most suitable
internship matches faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `jobbibot.jar` https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JobbiBot.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI like the one below should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command `start` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] if you would like to begin a conversation with JobbiBot.
.  Alternatively, if you would like to search for an internship directly without conversing with JobbiBot. Type your command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`* : open the help window
* *`list`* : lists all internship
* **`save`**`3` : save the 3rd internship shown in the current list to a personal Saved Internship Collection
* **`find saved`** : view the Saved Internship Collection
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for more details of each command.

[[Features]]

Format: `new`

// end::startnew[]

// tag::findwithfeature[]

=== Find internships by keyword(s): `find` [since v1.2]

Finds internships which contains any of the keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****

* The find is case insensitive. e.g `analyst` will match `Analyst`
* Tags other than 'saved' tag attached when using find/search function will be removed when using `list`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Sales Marketing` will match `Marketing Sales`
* Duplicate keywords does not matter e.g `Sales Marketing Sales` is simply `Sales Marketing`
* Internships matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. an OR search). e.g. `Micro Dyson` will return `Dyson Technology`, `Dyson Engineering` `Microsoft`
* Keyword(s) matching the internship is added to the internship as tag(s).
* Keyword tags are reset if user types the `find` command again.

****

Examples:

* `find Data Analyst` +
Returns any internship with `Data` or `Analyst` in its description.
* `find Dow Micron Dyson` +
Returns any internship having names or description matching `Dow`, `Micron`, or `Dyson`.
* `find Engineering` +
Returns any internship having `Engineering` in its description.
* `find Serangoon` +
Returns any internship that has a region matching `Serangoon` in it.
* `find 800` +

Tip: use `sort salary` to see internship containing salaries above a certain value

// end::findwithfeature[]

// tag::filterSort[]
=== Filtering Internship by keyword(s): `filter` [since v1.3]

Filters the displayed internship list according to the given keywords.  +
Format: `filter KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* Only internships in the last searched (find command) list will be filtered
* If there is no last searched (find command), filter command will filter from the entire list
* If the list command is used, the searched list (find command) is reset, and any filter command used before find command will filter the entire list
* The keywords is case insensitive. e.g `marketing` will match `Marketing`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Marketing Analytics` will match `Analytics Marketing`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Market` will not match `Marketing`
* Note that there is no tags added unlike the case of find command, as the filter command matches only internships containing all the keywords argument and hence there is no need to distinguish between the different keywords.
* Only internships which contain all the keyword will be returned. e.g `filter Marketing Analytics` will return only internships containing Marketing AND Analytics but not Marketing Research or Data Analytics
****

Examples:

* `filter data` +
Returns any entries containing data. e.g Data Analytics, Data Science
* `filter data analytics` +
Returns only entries containing data and analytics. e.g `data analytics internship`, `data analytics singapore`

Format: `sort KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +
Keywords are only limited to the following internship attribute types: `Industry` `Region` `Name` `Role` `Salary` +
Keywords can include '-' (e.g `-Industry` `-Region` `-Name` `-Role` `-Salary`) to reverse the order of the sort for that attribute

****
* Salary is sorted from highest to lowest by default
* Other attributes are sorted from A-Z by default
* '-' character before the attribute (e.g -industry) causes that attribute to be sorted in revese order
* The sort is case insensitive. e.g `name` will match `Name`
* The ordering of the keywords matters. e.g `sort Name Salary` will sort name before salary
* Only the first three keywords will be sorted. Subsequent keywords will be ignored
****

Examples:

* `sort name` +
Sorts the internship list according to name attribute.
* `sort salary region` +
