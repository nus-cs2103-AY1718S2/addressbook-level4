== Project: Your TA

'''

== Overview

Your TA is a desktop contact and task manager application used to manage the many students and deadlines that a university teaching assistant (TA) has. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major feature*: Added *tasks* that can be scheduled and a *calendar* that scheduled task would appear in.

** What it does: Allows the user to schedule specific tasks into *Your TA*. The scheduled task will then be displayed on the calendar with a colour code based on the tasks *priority* level.

** Justification: This feature is an entirely new function for the user to manage the deadlines of the array of tasks and deadlines that comes with the job of being a teaching assistant. This makes it such that *Your TA* not only helps manage particulars of students, but also the user's (TA) personal tasks.

** Highlights: This feature is brand new that adds a significant amount of functionality to *Your TA*. It required an in-depth planning process of design. The implementation too was challenging as it required the creation of a fully functional calendar, and linking tasks to the calendar such that only tasks with deadlines scheduled on that day would be displayed on that calendar node.

** Credits: Most of the base code of the `Task` class were adapted from the existing `Person` class.

* *Minor feature*: Added matriculation number field to the people added to *Your TA*. And `find` command now finds matching matriculation numbers to the keyword.

** Justification: *Your TA* is made for teaching assistants in universities, the matriculation number field and the `find` command supporting this field provides more user friendliness when searching for a student.

== Task, To-do list and Calendar Features

To see how the task scheduling feature works on the `Todo List` and `Calendar`, select the `Todo Lit` tab located right beside the `Person List` tab.

=== Adding a task: `addTask`

Adds a task to the address book. +
Alias: `at` +
Format: `addTask title/TITLE desc/TASK DESCRIPTION by/DEADLINE priority/PRIORITY`

New tasks will be added into the *To-do list* and *Calendar*. +

[NOTE]
====
* `DEADLINE` must be in the format of dd-MM-YYYY.
* Deadline has to be a date that exists.
* The month value has to be a month no more than 6 months after the current month (Start counting to 6 from the next month).
* Tasks do not need to be unique (in any field title, description, dealine or priority). Duplicate tasks are allow.
====

Examples:

Current date: 15-04-2018 +
The application initially starts with no tasks:

.Initial application view. +
image::UIFromDelete.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `addTask title/Grade Exams desc/Grade mid-terms by/20-04-2018 priority/2` +
This will add a task, 'Grade mid-terms' into the list with his respective details into the application (Figure 30).

.New task "Grade Exams" added. +
image::FirstTask.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `addTask title/Submit Attendance desc/Submit tutorial attendance by/21-04-2018 priority/3` +
This will add a task, 'Submit tutorial attendance' into the calendar and to-do list with the respective details into the application (Figure 31).

.New task "Submit Attendance" added. +
image::SecondTask.png[width="800"]

=== Editing a task: `editTask`

Edits a task to the address book. +
Alias: `et` +
Format: `editTask INDEX [title/TASK TITLE] [desc/TASK DESCRIPTION] [by/DEADLINE] [priority/PRIORITY]`

[NOTE]
====
Not all fields are required, you may only pick the fields that you want to edit.
====

The specified tasks will be edited in the *Todo List* and *Calendar*.

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the last task listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

Current date: 15-04-2018 +
The application initially starts with 2 tasks:

.Initial application view. +
image::SecondTask.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `editTask 1 priority/1` +
This will add a task, 'Grade mid-terms' into the list with his respective details into the application (Figure 33).

.Task at index 1 priority changed to 1. +
image::FirstEditTask.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `editTask 2 by/23-04-2018` +
This will add a task, 'Submit tutorial attendance' into the calendar and to-do list with the respective details into the application (Figure 34).

.Task at index 2 deadline changed to 23-04-2018. +
image::SecondEditTask.png[width="800"]

=== Deleting a task: `deleteTask`

Deletes a task in the address book. +
Alias: `dt` +
Format: `deleteTask INDEX`

The specified indexed task will be deleted from the *Todo List* and *Calendar*.

Examples:

Current date: 15-04-2018 +
The application initially starts with 2 tasks:

.Initial application view. +
image::SecondEditTask.png[width="800"]

Command entered: `deleteTask 1` +
This will add a task, 'Grade mid-terms' into the list with his respective details into the application (Figure 36).

.Task at index 1 removed. +

== Design

=== Model

...

The `Task` Class:

* Stores the information of a specific task in the AddressBook
* Information includes: Task Description, Deadline, Priority.
* Implements `UniqueTaskList` that enforces uniqueness of its elements and disallows nulls.
* `Task Description`: Object that stores the task description of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Task's name can contain any alphanumeric characters, but should not be null.
* `Deadline`: Object that stores the deadline of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Deadline should not be dates of the past and should only be in the format dd-mm-yyyy.
* `Priority`: Object that stores the priority of the `Task` Object.
[NOTE]
Priority should only be a value from 1 to 3, 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest.

== Implementation

...

// tag::matricuationNumber[]
=== Matriculation number

This feature allows the user to keep track of the matriculation number of a `Person`. The matriculation number in this case
has to start with an "A" or "U" followed by 7 digits and end with a capital letter. A new class, `Matriculation Number`, is created and is associated to the `Person` class.
This is integrated into the `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` commands to update the participation marks of a `Person`.

==== Current implementation

The user will input an AddCommand or EditCommand, with the additional parameter `m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, to the application to update the marks.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Should 2 people be allowed to have to same matriculation number

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** No, no 2 people can have the same matriculation number, DuplicateUserException will be thrown when trying to add a person with a matriculation number already inside Your TA.
** Pros: It makes sense as no 2 students would have the same matriculation number, it alerts the user when they've most likely typed in the wrong matriculation number.
** Cons: The user will not be able to add 2 different instances of the same student.
* **Alternative 2:** Duplicate matriculation numbers are allowed
** Pros: User have more freedom to add anyone.
** Cons: Duplicate matriculation numbers will cause messiness when dealing with many students.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

** Link matriculation number to the students IVLE account info.
// end::matriculationNumber[]

...

// tag::calendar[]
=== Tasks on calendar view

** This feature allows the user to see the calendar on the UI and see the scheduled `Task` deadlines on the calendar.

==== Current implementation

The user will enter a command `addTask title/TITLE desc/DESCRIPTION by/DEADLINE priority/PRIORITY` to the application. The application will then rely on `AddressBookparser` and
parse the argument. The argument will be passed into the AddTaskCommand to be executed. From there, it will create a new `Task` object that will be
added to the `calendarList` of the `UniqueTaskList` which in turn will be displayed on the date of the deadline, on the calendar.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to link specific tasks to the correct calendar nodes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a 7 by 32, 2D `Array` to store the tasks to be added into the calendar.
** Pros: Separate from the Task list (less prone to bugs). Faster run time (does not need to iterate through all tasks).
** Cons: Higher memory usage constraint, can only schedule tasks up to 6 months in advance to prevent high memory usage that will affect the speed and performance of the app.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the task list itself to be displayed in the calendar.
** Pros: Easier to program and less memory usage (only 1 task list is used without another 2D array for the calendar), tasks can be scheduled as far ahead as desired.
** Cons: Needs to iterate through the entire task list for every calendar node when loading the calendar view (slows performance when dealing with tasks).

===== Aspect: Viewing the calendar only by month

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a monthly only calendar view.
** Pros: Easy view of the current tasks that are due on that month.
** Cons: Not much choice for the user as only the monthly view is provided.
* **Alternative 2:** Give the user a choice to switch between weekly, monthly or yearly, e.g. _calendarfx_.
** Pros: User has more choice and freedom to control their UI.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, also if 3rd party programs such at _calendarfx_ is used, certain features in those programs are redundant (e.g. map) and would only slow the app down.

==== Future enhancements (Coming in v2.0)

** Link specific key-press or select actions to the todo list such that a click on either side will display the selected task on the other.
