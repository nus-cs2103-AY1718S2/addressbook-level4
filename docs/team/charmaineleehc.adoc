== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to send out auto-generated emails containing job details*
** What it does: allows the user to send out auto-generated emails about the job details to all the assigned employees of the job.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can so conveniently inform their employees about the job that will be doing. The user no longer have to call or type out the emails themselves.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required being able to connect to Gmail in order to send out emails to all employees assigned to the job with the specific job details as the content.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
