== Introduction

*Your TA* is for university Teaching Assistants (TAs) who prefer using a desktop application to manage student contacts and plan schedules. +

Its features include a login system, tools to manage students' information, task schedulers linked to a calendar and many more! +

It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface* (GUI). +
This means if you prefer using the keyboard over the mouse and can type fast, it can get your contact management and scheduling done faster than traditional GUI applications. +

This user guide will take you through the features and commands available for use.

== Quick Start

Before you can use *Your TA*, follow these steps to set up the application and its necessary tools:

.  Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `YourTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The Login GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in Figure 1 below.
+
.Login GUI upon startup
image::Login.png[width="500"]

.  Enter your `Username` and `Password` to log in. _Refer to <<Features>> for details of the feature._
[TIP]
If you're a first-time user without an account, enter your desired `Username` and `Password` and an account will be created and you will be logged in automatically.

After logging in, you should now see the main Application GUI appear. +
The key parts of the GUI (as shown in Figure 2 below) are: +

.  Person List (displays all contacts)
.  Todo List (displays all outstanding tasks)
.  Calendar
.  Command Box (field where you input your commands)
.  Results Display Panel (field where results of commands appear)

.Parts of the GUI
image::UiParts.png[width="800"]

Tips on using the command box:

*  The command box is where you type in commands followed by pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
For instance, typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window for the application.
*  Some example commands you can try:

** *`list`* : lists all contacts.
** **`add`** `n/John Doe` `m/A0167352F` `p/98765432` `e/johnd@example.com` `a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds `John Doe` as a contact with their respective details.
** **`delete`** `3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
** *`exit`* : exits the application.

*  Refer to <<Contact Features>> and <<Task, To-do list and Calendar Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]

== Login Feature

Before you are able to access the application, login is required.
====
* Enter your `Username` and `Password` in the respective fields. +
* Click on the `login` button.
* If you have entered either of those incorrectly, the text "[Existing user: Incorrect password entered] [New User: Password must contain 8-30 characters]" will be displayed. +
 This means that if you are an existing user (i.e. have logged in before), you have entered your password incorrectly, and if you are a new user, your password does not meet the specified requirements for a creation of a password.
 You have an unlimited number of tries to log in. +
* Upon successful login, the application will load with your previously (if applicable) saved data.
====

[NOTE]
When creating a username and password, they need to be alphanumeric (contain only numbers and alphabets).

[NOTE]
Both `Username` and `Password` fields are case-sensitive.

[TIP]
If you are a first-time user, create an account by entering your desired `Username` and `Password` in the username and password text fields respectively. +
Then, press kbd:[ENTER] or click `Login`.

Example:

Say you want to create an account with the following credentials.

Username: newUser +
Password: Iamanewuser

Upon typing in the credentials, a new instance of *Your TA* will start up as seen in Figure 3 below.

.Main Application GUI upon Login
image::Ui.png[width="800"]

If you log out then log back in with the same username (newUser) but an incorrect password (Iamnotanewuser, for instance), an error message will be displayed as seen in Figure 4 below.

.Wrong Password
image::LoginFail.png[width="500"]

== Command Info

These are the guidelines on how the command format will be represented in the rest of this guide.

====
*Command Format*

* Commands have _aliases_, which are either shorter versions of the commands or their equivalent symbols. +
e.g. `add` `n/John Doe`, 'a` `n/John Doe` or `+` `n/John Doe` all result in John Doe being added as a contact, where "add" is the command itself, and "a" and "+" are its aliases.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add` `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add` `n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero). +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend` `t/family`, or even not used at all.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME` `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER` `n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====


== Help Feature

This guide can be opened in *Your TA* itself, with the use of the `help` command.

Viewing help : `help`

Alias: `?` +
Format: `help`
[NOTE]
This opens a help window which explains what commands can be used, and how to use them.

== Contact Features

This section shows an in-depth explanation of the commands available to be used on entries found in the *Person List*.

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person (student) into the person list. +

Alias: `a` and `+` +
Format: `add` `n/NAME` `m/MATRICULATION NUMBER` `p/PHONE_NUMBER` `e/EMAIL` `a/ADDRESS` `dp/[IMAGE PATH]` `[t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
Both the display picture and tags fields are optional, and a person can have any number of tags (including zero).

[NOTE]
The tags "lecturer", "TA" "student" and "T1" will appear red, yellow, blue and green respectively.

[NOTE]
Do refrain from using high resolution images as display pictures, the optimum resolution is 500 x 500 pixels.

[WARNING]
The name field of Your TA will allow duplicate names to be stored (but not duplicate people, where all fields are the same). +
However, the matriculation number field does not allow duplicates.

Examples:

The application initially starts with default inputs as displayed in Figure 5 below.

.Default Address Book State +
image::UiInitialClear.png[width="800"]

Let's try entering a command. +

Command entered: `add` `n/John Doe` `m/A0111111X` `p/98765432` `e/johnd@example.com` `a/John street, block 123, #01-01` `dp/C:\Users\Name\Desktop\John.jpg` +
[NOTE]
The filepath after the `dp/` depends on where your image file is located.

Result: This will add 'John Doe' into the person list with his respective details (as seen in Figure 6).

.John Doe Added +
image::UiAfterFirst.png[width="800"]

Let's try another command. +

Command entered: `add` `n/Betsy Crowe` `t/friend` `m/A1234567C` `e/betsycrowe@example.com` `a/Newgate Prison` `p/1234567` `t/criminal` +

Result: This will add 'Betsy Crowe' into the person list with her respective details (as seen in Figure 7).

.Betsy Crowe Added +
image::UiAfterSecond.png[width="800"]

[TIP]
You may leave the `dp/` portion empty if you do not have a profile picture. The application will default to using the default profile picture.


=== Locating persons by name or matriculation number: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords or whose matriculation number corresponds to the given keyword and lists them as results. +

Alias: `f` +
Format: `find KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the name and the matriculation number are searched for keywords.
* Only full words will be matched +
e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). +
e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
****

Examples:

The application starts with the following as shown in Figure 8 below.

.Application before Find +
image::UiAfterSecond.png[width="800"]

Let's say you're looking for a person with the name 'John'.

Command entered: `find` `John` +

.Returns 'John Doe' +
image::FindJohn.png[width="300"]

The next command shows how to search using multiple keywords.

Command entered: `find` `Betsy` `Tim` `John` +

Result: The application searches for the keywords 'Betsy', 'Tim' and 'John' and returns 2 results (see Figure 10).

.Returns 'John Doe' and 'Betsy Crowe' +
image::FindBTJ.png[width="300"]

The next command shows how to search using matriculation number.

Command entered: `find` `A0111111X` +

Result: The application searches for the person with the matriculation number as shown and returns 1 result (see Figure 11).

.Returns 'John Doe', with Matriculation Number 'A0111111X' +
image::FindMatric.png[width="300"]

=== Listing all persons: `list`

Displays a list of all persons in the application. +

image::AllListed.png[width="300"]


=== Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person (has already been added) in the application. +

Alias: `e` +
Format: `edit` `INDEX` `[n/NAME]` `[m/MATRICULATION NUMBER]` `[p/PHONE]` `[e/EMAIL]` `[a/ADDRESS]` `[dp/IMAGE PATH]` `[t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. +
The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Replaced display pictures will be removed from storage upon the logging in to the same account during the next start up of *Your TA*.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed +
i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can reset a person's display picture to default by typing `dp/` with no [IMAGE PATH] written after it.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

[NOTE]
Do refrain from using high resolution images as display pictures, the optimum resolution is 500 x 500 pixels.

Examples:

Address book starts with the following as shown in Figure 13 below.

.Application Before Edit +
image::AllListed.png[width="300"]

Say you wish to edit the details of 'Betsy Crowe'.

Command entered: `edit` `2` `p/91234567` `e/johndoe@example.com` `dp/C:\Users\Name\Desktop\betsy.jpg` +

Result: This changes the details of the person with index 2 (Betsy Crowe) and writes over her original saved details (Figure 14).

.Phone and Email of 2nd Person (Betsy Crowe) Edited +

// tag::participation[]
=== Adding participation marks: `markPart`

Adds to the participation marks of a person (student). The maximum limit for participation marks is 100
and the maximum amount that can be added per execution of the command is 100. +
i.e. if someone has 90 marks and you add 20, the participation marks will be capped at 100.

If the marks is below 50, there will be a red frame surrounding the person's profile picture. If the person has 50 or more marks, the colored frame around the user will change to green.

Format: `markPart` `INDEX` `marks/DIGITS`

****
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The marks to be added must be a *positive integer* between 0 and 100 inclusive.

Format: `clear`

[NOTE]
This command clears ALL the data from the application (both people and tasks). The display pictures files will be cleared as well upon the next application startup.

[WARNING]
This is a dangerous command. If unintentionally applied, simply use the command `undo` to revert it. Otherwise, if application is closed without reverting, all data will be lost.

=== Importing data from another file: `import`

Extracts data from an xml formatted file and
replaces the current stored data. +

Format: `import` `FILEPATH`

Example:

Command entered: +
`import ~/download/NewData.xml`

== Saving the data

Application data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== Additional Information on Features

This section provides more information on certain features of *Your TA*.

=== Add command

The `add` command adds a person into the application. +
This command has specific compulsory (must-have) and non-compulsory fields. +

Compulsory fields:

* Name
* Matriculation Number
* Phone Number
* Email Address
* Address

Non-Compulsory fields:

* Tags
* Display Picture

Each individual field has a specific format requirement. +
e.g the NAME field must only contain letters.

If the wrong format is detected, the application will prompt you of the correct input format in the results display panel right underneath the command input line.

=== Undo command

As stated in section 8.2, certain commands (not all) can be undone.

Commands that cannot be undone:

* `list`
* `sort`
* `find`

=== Calendar

* The calendar fills up based on the day of the first day of the month, and since the calendar only allows 35 days to be displayed, this will cause some months (e.g. September 2018) to be cut off.
* The unfilled nodes of the calendar will be filled with the days of either the previous or next month. (Depending on the layout of the current month).

[TIP]
To see the last few days of the final month, click on the `>>` button to navigate to the next month's calendar. +
The last days of that month will be displayed there, with its tasks.

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +

*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file of your previous *Your TA* folder.

*Q*: How do i keep my information safe? +

*A*: A login feature has already been implemented as of v1.5, which ensures that a user can only access their own accounts via authentication.
