== Introduction

Pigeons is a delivery-tracking tool for both business-owners and delivery drivers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their delivery process*.
Pigeons is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Pigeons can get your delivery management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The recommended way to use Pigeons is to first load in the delivery data by a centralised administrator for each delivery driver,
and then allow each driver to login to their own account and filter by today's date to retrieve the route for the deliveries
they have for the day.
// end::introductionSK[]

* Users will be able to add individuals to the address book and route out deliveries based on the day
* The program will return attributes that will make the delivery mans life easier such as distance to destination and best time to leave
