Without further ado, let's see what ET can do!  Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

=== Knowing the User Interface

_Figure 5_ shows the 5 major components of the user interface of Employees Tracker (ET):

* Command Box:where you type in commands
* Result Display Box: where ET shows text result to you
* Employees List Panel: where the list of all employees is shown
* Employee's Profile Panel: where the details of the selected employee is shown
* Notification cards: where ET reminds you about events

.User Interface
image::UiLabelled.jpg[width="790"]

=== Reading the result display box

The result display box shows 3 types of information:

* Error messages in [red]#red#, if the command you entered does not exists or does not match the pre-defined format.
* Hints about the format and usage of the command in [maroon]#maroon#.
* Statuses of Employees Tracker in [maroon]#maroon#, if your command is processed successfully.

[NOTE]
Whenever you type keyword of a command in the `Command Box`, ET will provide [maroon]#hints# about its usage.

=== Understanding the notifications
ET has a 2 phase notification system, i.e. there will be 2 notification cards popping up to remind you of each event.

* The first phase notification will pop out in a [blue]#blue# notification card, on the day of expiry, as shown in _Figure 6_.
* The second phase notification will pop out in a [red]#red# notification card, at the exact time of expiry, as shown in _Figure 7_.

.First phase notification card
image::card_blue.png[width=""]

.Second phase notification card
image::card_red.png[width=""]

For example, suppose you have assigned a task to Alex which will due on 15^th^ Apr 2018 0032 hrs. When you open ET for the first time in the morning of 15^th^ Apr 2018, you will be notified that Alex has a task that will due on *today* in a [blue]#blue# notification card. Later at 0032 hrs of 15^th^ Apr 2018, you will receive the second phase notification in [red]#red#, informing you that Alex should have finished the task by *now* .

Notification cards will disappear from the screen after 5 seconds and will be stored in the `Notification Center`. If you want to refer to them later, use `noti` command or double press kbd:[Shift] to open the `Notification Center`.

Also, if you minimizes ET to use other software, ET is capable of showing notification cards in your computer's system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), as shown in _Figure 8_. However, this feature may not work on some computer systems.

.ET shows notification card about event expiry even if you are using other programs.
