== Introduction

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is a desktop records management application targeted at private clinics that may have multiple branches.
It aims to replace how private clinics handle the management of patient records, making the process much more easier and efficient.
IMDB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This makes it perfect for doctors or staff who can type faster than they can navigate with a mouse.
If your clinic has medical staff who can type fast, IMDB can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional pen and paper or even normal GUI apps.
Head to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

The symbols which are used in the User Guide as well as their meaning are listed below: +
