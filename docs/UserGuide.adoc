== Introduction

=== About the App

ProgressChecker is for *students* who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of their learning progress for module CS2103/T.

In this version, you can add your teammates details into ProgressChecker. You can also create a new task list that syncs with Google Tasks. ProgressChecker displays link:DeveloperGuide.adoc#Learning-Outcomes[Learning Outcomes] and exercises pulled from the https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/website/index.html[CS2103/T module website]. Students can use these information to track their weekly homework and the progress of the project.

More importantly, ProgressChecker is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:DeveloperGuide.adoc#GUI[GUI]).
If you are reasonably comfortable with using CLI, ProgressChecker can get your learning and project development tracking done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

Interested? Now you are ready to jump to the <<Quick Start,Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

. Next, let's add a teammate's details to your contact list. +
Type **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science y/2 g/johndoe` +
Teammate John Doe should now be listed in your contact list. +
image:TeammateAddedIndication.png[width="300"]
. After adding all of your teammates' details into ProgressChecker, you will need to load the tasks you're required to do into ProgressChecker. +
Type **`nl`** to bring up the Google account authorization page. Select `Allow`. +
You should see the feedback that a verification code has been received. Return to ProgressChecker. +
[NOTE]
This step in syncing of tasks can take up to 40 seconds. ProgressChecker might be in the state of not responding in the meantime. +
. Once the tasks have been loaded, you can view them. +
Type **`view task`** then **`vt *`** +
You should now be on the Task tab and see a list of learning outcomes.
. When you have completed a learning outcome, you can mark them as complete. +
Type **`ct`**`1` to mark your first learning outcome as complete.
You should now see that the status of the learning outcome has turned green with a tick in the checkbox.
. Now, let's try answering an exercise. +
Type **`view`**`exercise` +
You should now be on the Exercise tab. You can scroll through and see the list of exercises available for week 11. Let's answer question index 11.1.1. +
Type **`ans`**`11.1.1 a` +
You should now see your answer and the suggested answer reflected under question index 11.1.1.
image:ExerciseAnsweredIndication.png[width="600"]
. You can also view exercises from other weeks.
Type **`view`**`exercise 5` +
You should now be seeing week 5's exercises in the Exercise tab.
. After checking your learning progress, you would want to manage your project development. +
Type **`view`**`issues` +
You should now be on the Issues tab. Now, let's login into GitHub. +
Type **`gitlogin`**`gu/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME pc/YOUR_GITHUB_PASSWORD r/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME` +
[NOTE]
Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `gitlogin gu/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`, `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` is a parameter which can be used as `gitlogin gu/JohnDoe`.
If you have successfully logged in, you should see the opened issues in your specified repository listed in the tab. +
. Next, let's create a GitHub issue to your repository. +
Type **`+issue`**`ti/Implement remark functionality` +
You should now see your newly created issue reflected under the Issues tab as well as under the issue tracker section of your specified GitHub repository.

And that is the general workflow you would have when using ProgressChecker each week! All changes you have made previously have all already been automatically saved. If you wish to close ProgressChecker now, you can type **`exit`** to quit.

There are more commands available for you to try. Refer to the <<List of All Commands,next section>> for the details of each command.

*Notes:*

* The commands are case-insensitive. However, for simplicity all the examples have the commands in lower case.
* You can auto-complete any command by pressing tab key.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
