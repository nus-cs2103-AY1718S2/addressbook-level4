== Introduction

EduBuddy is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing student profiles*. More importantly, EduBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EduBuddy can get your student profile management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EduBuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list` or `l`* : lists all students
* **`add` or `a`**`n/John Doe p/91234567 ic/S9315585J t/1A t/20` : adds a student named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete` or `d`**`3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME ic/S9500186H`, `ic/S9500186H n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `n/NAME [t/CLASS]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/1A` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Command input is not case sensitive, e.g 'fInD Alex' , 'find alex' works the same.
