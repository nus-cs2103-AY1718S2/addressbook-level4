== PROJECT: link:{repoURL}[Bibliotek]

This portfolio page showcases my contributions to Bibliotek.

== Overview

Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast, and easy to use. It is targeted at heavy readers who require a hassle-free way of managing and keep tracking of their read and unread books.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added a command to *search for books in National Library Board (NLB) catalogue*
** What it does: Allows the user to easily check for the availability of books in NLB libraries.
** Justification: The user may wish to check if a book is available in the library before deciding whether to read it, or may just want a convenient way of searching for books in the library.
** Highlights: This function paves the way to extensions beyond NLB libraries and to customized automated book availability checking; functionalities which make Bibliotek more unique.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to *view recently selected books*
** What it does: Allows the user to view his recently selected books.
** Justification: The user may have recently selected a book in one of his/her searches, and regret not adding that book into his/her book shelf. With this function, he/she can easily locate that book without having to perform the searches again.
