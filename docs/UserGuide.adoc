== Introduction

Are you a veterinarian or a veterinary assistant in need of help to manage growing number of contacts, never-ending list of pet patients and floods of appointments? Are you having nightmares over the sheer amount of data to catalogue? Are you struggling to find the right pet patient's details and owner's contact amongst a plethora of paper records for each of your appointment?

Medeina is finally here to solve your problems.

| Notes

.^a|Command word
| `add`, `edit`, `clear`, `help`, `undo`
a| * Medeina's syntax starts with a command word.

.^a|Alias
| `a`, `ed`, `cls`, `h`, `ud`
a| * Aliases are short-forms that can be used to replace command words.

.^a|Options
| `**-o**`, `**-p**`, `**-a**`, `**-fo**`, `**-fp**`, `**-y**`
a| * Options are used in `add`, `edit`, `find`, `delete` and `listappt` commands.
* You can specify them to execute variants of a command. For example in figure 2, `**-p**` option denotes editing a pet patient.
* If there are multiple options used in a command, the order must be preserved.

.^a|Index
| `1`, `2`, any number
a| * Index is used to refer to a particular contact, pet patient or appointment that you would like to `edit` or `delete`.
* Please refer to figure 1 to find out where indexes are found.

.^a|Prefixes
| `n/`, `p/`, `nr/`, `e/`, `s/`, `t/`
a| * Prefixes mark the start of parameters.
* They indicate the type of parameter expected by Medeina e.g. `nr/` will expect NRIC as parameter, and `e/` will expect an email address as parameter.

.^a|Parameters
| `Persian`, `ginger`, `asthma` +
 +
In `nr/NRIC`, `NRIC` represents the parameter
a| * Parameters are values supplied by the user.
* They are represented by words in upper case.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

.^a|Tag
| Any parameter marked by `t/` prefix
a| * In this guide and also in error messages, when tag is bounded in square brackets e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, it means that tag is optional. You can specify `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* `[t/TAG]...` denotes multiple tags can be supplied by the user e.g. `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

// tag::autocompleteUG[]
=== Autocomplete `[Since v1.3]`

.Medeina's autocomplete for command words, prefixes and options
image::autocomplete.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Medeina comes with an autocomplete feature in the CLI to help you manage your contacts, pet patients and appointments faster.

* Medeina supports autocomplete for command words, options, prefixes, and parameters such as tags, NRIC, pet patient name, species, breed, colour and blood type.
* Autocomplete will provide suggestions for NRIC when you are adding a new pet patient or new appointment, assigning pet patient under another contact using the edit command, and finding a contact by NRIC.
* Autocomplete will provide suggestions for pet patient name when you are adding an appointment.
* Suggestions for tags, species, breed, colour and blood type will be shown when their corresponding prefixes are detected.
* Autocomplete matching is **case-insensitive** e.g. you will see autocomplete suggestions 'edit' and 'exit' when you type 'E'.
* You can use kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down], or kbd:[Tab] to traverse through the autocomplete suggestions in the drop-down menu.
* Autocomplete shows up to a maximum of 13 suggestions in the drop-down menu.
* Press kbd:[Enter] to select an autocomplete suggestion in the drop-down menu.

[NOTE]
====
Autocomplete for options, prefixes and parameters works only for commands that require them: `add`, `edit`, `find`, `delete` and `listappt`.

[TIP]
====
You can toggle autocomplete on/off using kbd:[F2] when the command box is focused.

== Future enhancements

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

{empty} +

=== Setting user permissions `[coming in v2.0]`

Coming v2.0, Medeina will have user permissions, to ensure that protected information is not easily changed by other staff. There will be an administrator role to gain total access in the application.

Information that vet assistants should not change:

* You can add new information (contacts, pet patients, appointments) to the application, but you should not be able to delete it.

* You can see the medical histories of pet patients but should not modify it.

Information that vets should not change:

== FAQ

*Q*: Help! What is with all these data in Medeina on initial startup? How do I get rid of them? +
*A*: This data is sample data aimed to get users started with Medeina. To start afresh, simply type `clear` into the command line, and all the sample data will be removed from the storage file.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the application in the other computer. Open the application, type `clear` into the command line, then close it. Replace the data file, found at `data\medeina.xml`, that it had created with the data file that contains the data found in your previous Medeina folder. By default, this file will also be `medeina.xml`, unless you have renamed it to something else!

*Q*: I have modified some entries in my saved data file directly. However, upon opening the application, Medeina does not recognise my data file anymore! What is happening? Is this a bug? +
*A*: This is not a bug. Upon opening Medeina, your existing data in the data file will be processed in accordance to certain restrictions, so that Medeina can display them appropriately for you. However, you may have edited some of the entries, such that it does not conform to these restrictions that we have set. As such, please ensure that all modifications of data *MUST* go through Medeina, otherwise your data file will not be recognised.

*Q*: There's no scroll-bar in calendar entry views, what happens when a have a long list of appointments on that week? +
*A*: The calendar entry view is implemented by default without a scroll-bar, yet user can still scroll up and down using mouse wheel.

*Q*: After switching from a year view with appointments to a year view with none, the appointment dates were still colored despite no entry, why is that? +
*A*: The issue is embedded inside the API of CalendarFx, it has already been documented in our developer guide as well. Hopefully the issue can be resolved in future releases of CalendarFX.

*Q*: When right click on the calendar day view, a window jump out and says "unable to create a new entry", why is that? +
*A*: Since Medeina is a command-line based application, clicking on calendar to create appointments has been disabled. User should create appointments using `add` command.

*Q*: When click on appointments, a pop over window appears to show details of appointments but its unmodifiable, why? +
*A*: Because of Medeina's command line based property, modifying of appointments details using mouse is disabled. Instead, users should use `edit` command.

*Q*: Suppose I want to make an appointment for a pet patient named "Happy". However, the contact that "Happy" is assigned under, has yet another pet patient that is named "Happy" as well. I end up making an appointment for the other "Happy" instead. What can I do?
*A*: Medeina is developed with the assumption that no pet patients under the same contact will share a name. However, there is a solution for such rare cases. Edit one of the pet patients to a name with a slight variation e.g. "Happy dog" to include species in the name for differentiation, or "Happy 1" to indicate the older pet patient for differentiation.
