== Introduction

Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedule and
contacts*. More importantly, SLAP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SLAP can get your daily scheduling and
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The application main window should appear in a few seconds.
.  You firstly need to create a user account with a unique username and password. (See `create-user` command in <<Features>>)
.  If you do not wish to create a new user, there is a default user account available. The username is "user" and the password is "pass".
.  Login into your account using the `login` command (See <<Features>>) and using your username and password.
.  If login is successful, the GUI below should appear.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
