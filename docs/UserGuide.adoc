== Introduction

Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedule and
contacts*. More importantly, SLAP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SLAP can get your daily scheduling and
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `slap-app.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The application main window should appear in a few seconds.
.  You firstly need to create a user account with a unique username and password. (See `create-user` command in <<Features>>)
.  If you do not wish to create a new user, there is a default user account available. The username is "user" and the password is "pass".
.  Login into your account using the `login` command (See <<Features>>) and using your username and password.
.  If login is successful, the GUI below should appear.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* * `add-log 2 log/Patient is feeling unwell today`* : Adds a session log to the 2nd person shown in the current list.
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

// tag::navigateCommand[]

=== Map Tools

==== Navigate between scheduled events : `navigate`
Displays the directions between planned locations on the daily scheduler map. +
Format: `navigate INDEX`

[WARNING]
====
Must be on `scheduler` view first for command to work, else nothing happens (i.e. run `switch schedule`).
`show-schedule d/DATE` has to be called BEFORE `navigate` can work properly.
To test function it is recommended to add sufficient number of events, i.e. 2 or more, to the particular date.
It is assumed that every event location used is valid.
====

****
* Displays direction between two different but adjacent events by specifying `INDEX`. This will display the direction
between `Event Num: INDEX` and `Event Num: INDEX + 1`. For example, `navigate 1` will show the directions between
the first and the second event of the day.
* `INDEX` must be more then `1`, but less than total events for the day minus ONE or `NUM_OF_EVENTS - 1`.
****

[TIP]
Number of buttons on the right of the scheduler panel map indicates how many navigation options are available.

Examples:

Switches to `calendar` tab and displays contents
* `show-schedule d/5 May` +
Retrieves events on the 5th of May.
* `navigate 1` +

// end::navigateCommand[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Tools
==== Opening a calendar : `calendar-launch`

Opens a calendar in a webview.
Format: `calendar-launch`

[NOTE]
====
The user can also open the calendar by pressing the `F8` function key, or by pressing `View > Open Calendar`.

The previous `calendar` command has been depricated since v1.4 in favour of the `switch calendar` command that properly opens
the calendar in the build-in scene switcher.

Logging in to the calendar interface DOES NOT perform the Oauth authentication process.
====

Examples:
* `calendar-launch`

Opens the Google Calendar web app in a new WebView.

==== Adding and event to the calendar : `calendar-add`

Allows a user to add an event directly to their calendar.

Format: `calendar-add title/EVENTNAME start/STARTDATETIME end/ENDDATETIME [loc/LOCATION]`

[NOTE]
====
Start/End times can be written in natural language (e.g. Today, This Friday, May 4, etc.)

The expected behaviour is such that if no time is provided with the date, the program will assume that the the desired
time is the current time. For example, if current time is 12am and the user does not specify a start or end time for the
two dates that they provide, then the application will use 12am as both the start and end time for their input dates.

Similarly, if no date is provided with the time, the program will assume that the desired day was the current day.
For example, if the current time is 4am, and the start date is 12am and the end date is 6am, the created event will
start on the current day at 12am and end at 6am on the same day.

The location parameter is optional.

`calendar-` commands rely on Google Oauth to modify the calendar. Whenever a `calendar-` command is executed, the
Oauth certificate will be checked. If the user has not authorized the SLAP app to manage their calendar, the SLAP
app will launch their system default browser (i.e. not a WebView) and ask them to select the account that they wish
to grant the SLAP app permission to edit. *Failure to authenticate will cause the program to freeze and crash.*
====

Examples:
* `calendar-add title/CS2103 Tutorial start/This Thursday at 3PM end/4PM on Thursday loc/NUS School of Computing, COM1, 13 Computing Drive, Singapore 117417`

Adds an event named CS2103 tutorial that starts on the upcoming Thursday at 3pm and ends at 4pm, at the NUS School of Computing, COM1

* `calendar-add title/CS2103 Tutorial start/May 2 3PM end/4PM on May 2`

Adds an event named CS2103 tutorial that starts on May 2 at 3pm and ends at 4pm with no location

==== List upcoming events in the command line: `calendar-list`

Allows a user to view their upcoming calendar events (limited to 250 events).

Format: `calendar-list`

[NOTE]
====
`calendar-` commands rely on Google Oauth to modify the calendar. Whenever a `calendar-` command is executed, the
Oauth certificate will be checked. If the user has not authorized the SLAP app to manage their calendar, the SLAP
app will launch their system default browser (i.e. not a WebView) and ask them to select the account that they wish
to grant the SLAP app permission to edit. *Failure to authenticate will cause the program to freeze and crash.*
====

Examples:
* `calendar-list`

Shows the user a list of their upcoming events (limited to 250 events).

==== Deleting an event from the calendar : `calendar-delete`

Allows the user to delete an event based on the index listed from the `calendar-list` or `show-schedule d/DATE` command.

Format: `calendar-delete INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
`calendar-` commands rely on Google Oauth to modify the calendar. Whenever a `calendar-` command is executed, the
Oauth certificate will be checked. If the user has not authorized the SLAP app to manage their calendar, the SLAP
app will launch their system default browser (i.e. not a WebView) and ask them to select the account that they wish
to grant the SLAP app permission to edit. *Failure to authenticate will cause the program to freeze and crash.*

If neither the `calendar-list` nor `show-schedule d/DATE` have been called previously, the command will do nothing.
====

Examples:
* `calendar-list`

Shows the user a list of their upcoming events (limited to 250 events) with indexes next to each event.

* `calendar-delete 1*

Deletes the first event on that list.

==== Editing an event in the calendar : `calendar-edit` [coming in v2.0]

Displays a list of upcoming events to the user and lets them select one to edit.

Format: `calendar-edit`

==== Reauthenticate Google Oauth : `reauthenticate`

Allows a user to manually reauthenticate their Google Oauth credentials/permissions for SLAP.

Format: `reauthenticate`


[NOTE]
====
This command is used to manually reauthenticate the Oauth certificate. The SLAP app will launch the system default
browser (i.e. not a WebView) and ask them to select the account that they wish to grant the SLAP app permission to
edit. *Failure to authenticate will cause the program to freeze and crash.*
====

Examples:
* `reauthenticate`

Deletes the user's existing Oauth certificate and attempts to regain authorization.

==== List upcoming events on a particular day in the command line: `show-schedule`

Allows a user to view their calendar events for a particular day.

Format: `show-schdeule d/DATE`

[NOTE]
====
Date can be written in natural language (e.g. Today, This Friday, May 4, etc.)

This command relies on Google Oauth to access the calendar. Whenever a Google Calendar-related command is executed, the
Oauth certificate will be checked. If the user has not authorized the SLAP app to manage their calendar, the SLAP
app will launch their system default browser (i.e. not a WebView) and ask them to select the account that they wish
to grant the SLAP app permission to edit. *Failure to authenticate will cause the program to freeze and crash.*
====

Examples
* show-schedule d/This Thursday

Shows a list of events that occur on this coming Thursday.

* show-schedule d/May 5

Shows a list of events that occur on May 5.
